, al - monitor online reported . major general vyacheslav gladkikh died after a roadside ied detonated under a convoy of russian soldiers and syrian pro - regime militiamen near the city of deir ez - zor . three other russian military personnel were wounded , russia \u2019 s state - run tass news agency reported . a local commander of syria \u2019 s national defense forces , a pro - assad militia , was also reportedly killed . \u201c they \u2019 ve changed their tactics there , \u201d said one source , who declined to be named for security reasons . \u201c they do nighttime infiltrations , lay mines and booby traps . \u201d video purporting to show the explosion circulated on social media this week . it was the first reported death of a russian general in syria since 2017 , when a lieutenant general was killed in the same province , reportedly by mortar fire from the islamic state , al - monitor reported . deir ez - zor and nearly all of syrian territory west of the euphrates river lie in syrian government hands , with the major exception of idlib province , the last rebel enclave in the country \u2019 s nearly decadelong civil war . us - backed and kurdish - led militias captured is \u2019 last remaining territory in march 2019 , but the desert countryside south and east of deir ez - zor on the regime \u2019 s side of the euphrates is rife with insurgents who continue

there to keep pressure on is in the border area , but rebels have told al - monitor that the proximity of russian and syrian forces on the roads outside the us - controlled zone make operations outside the area difficult .", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Life.Die", "Victim": [[["general"]]], "Place": [[["syria"]]], "Participant": [], "PassengerArtifact": [], "Instrument": [],

who police are not naming for operational reasons , was also a recognized islamic state follower in the streets around his home in the east london district of barking , where he tried to recruit children and proselytized openly in a nearby park , sparking a complaint to the police by a local resident . the 27 - year - old , father of at least two young children , appeared also in a television documentary last year in which he was pictured unfurling an islamic state banner and later arguing with police during a london protest organized by radical preacher anjem choudary , a convicted is recruiter . last month , community and mosque leaders in manchester and neighbors of salman abedi , the british - libyan who carried out the may 22 concert bombing in the city , accused the security services of missing several opportunities to identify him as a high - risk militant . file - a police officer stands outside didsbury mosque in manchester , britain , may 24 , 2017 . at least five times locals warned the police of their fears about the 22 - year - old suicide bomber . one community worker said he contacted authorities after abedi said being a suicide bomber was ok . insufficient response neither britain \u2019 s domestic intelligence service mi5 nor the manchester police responded to the claims , but lawmakers have demanded to know why abedi was seen just as a peripheral figure and one not requiring surveillance and investigation . file - salman abedi , the bomber behind the manchester suicide bombing , is seen in this image taken from cctv on the night he committed the attack in this handout photo released , may 27 , 2017 , from the greater manchester police . similar questions are being prompted again in the wake of the van - and - knife attack in the london bridge district of britain \u2019 s capital . erica gasparri , a mother of three who lived in barking told local media she had reported abedi two years ago , after he approached kids in a local

underground system . file - police attend to an incident on london bridge in london , britain , june 3 , 2017 . a onetime friend of the ringleader also told the bbc that he warned police , alerting them to comments made about previous terrorist attacks in britain and of his alarm at the man ' s increasingly extremist beliefs . the friend said the alleged attacker was a keen follower of american radical preacher ahmad musa jibril and would watch youtube videos of the cleric . \u201c he used to listen to a lot of musa jibril , \u201d he told the bbc . \u201c i phoned the anti - terror hotline . i spoke to the gentleman . i told him about our conversation and why i think he was radicalized . . . i did my bit , i know a lot of other people did their bit , but the authorities did not do their bit , \u201d he added . security strategy review a senior conservative official told voa that there is deep frustration in downing street about saturday \u2019 s attack and the fact that at least one of the assailants was known to the authorities . prime minister theresa may promised to review britain \u2019 s counter - terrorism strategy , holding out the prospects of enhanced powers for the
