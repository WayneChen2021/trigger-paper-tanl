[{"docid": "K0C041O37", "doctext": "analysis backs claim drones were used to attack venezuela \u2019 s president analysis of open source information carried out by the investigative website bellingcat suggests drones that had been repurposed as flying bombs were indeed used in an attack on the president of venezuela this weekend . the venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate president nicol\u00e1s maduro using two drones loaded with explosives . the president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred . initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of maduro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . but the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . ap also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim \u2014 suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of maduro \u2019 s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . the venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were dji matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of c4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . dji matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work \u2014 with a u . s . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out \u2014 with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . bellingcat says its analysis supports the government \u2019 s claim that the drone model used was a dji matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors . it also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model , although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed . venezuela \u2019 s interior minister , nestor reverol , also claimed the government thwarted the attack using \" special techniques and ( radio ) signal inhibitors \" , which \" disoriented \" the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand \u2014 a capability bellingcat notes the venezuelan security services are reported to have . the second drone was said by reverol to have \" lost control \" and crashed into a nearby building . bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion . it adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed . \" it is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated , creating the hole in the wall of this apartment , igniting a fire , and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in video 2 ( of the state tv broadcast of maduro \u2019 s speech ) , \" it further suggests . here \u2019 s its conclusion : from the open sources of information available , it appears that an attack took place using two dbieds while maduro was giving a speech . both the drones appear visually similar to dji matrice 600s , with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model . these drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade . the first drone detonated somewhere above or near the parade , the most likely cause of the casualties announced by the venezuelan government and pictured on social media . the second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage , and is the most likely cause of the fire which the venezuelan firefighters described . it also considers the claim of attribution by a group on social media , calling itself \" soldados de franelas \" ( aka \u2018 t - shirt soldiers \u2019 \u2014 a reference to a technique used by protestors wrapping a t - shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity ) , suggesting it \u2019 s not clear from the group \u2019 s twitter messages that they are \" unequivocally claiming responsibility for the event \" , owing to use of passive language , and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government snipers \u2014 which it says \" does not appear to be supported by the open source information available \" .", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack", "Instrument": [[["drones"]]], "Target": [[["president"]]], "Participant": [], "PassengerArtifact": [],

d ) said sunday that there is \u201c no evidence of an international terrorism connection \u201d in the explosion in chelsea , though he stopped short of saying whoever caused the incident did not want to incite terror . ad \u201c it depends on your definition of terrorism , \u201d cuomo said . \u201c a bomb exploding in new york is obviously an act of terrorism , but it \u2019 s not linked to international terrorism . in other words , we find no isis connections . \u201d ad he said later : \u201c this is the nightmare scenario . \u201d not long after the blast , police said they had found another possible explosive device just blocks away . this device appeared to be similar to a pressure cooker and had wiring on it , according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation . pressure cookers were used in the two bombs detonated at the boston marathon in 2013 . the bomb squad safely removed the second device , new york police tweeted early sunday . police officers , firefighters and other first responders had rushed to the scene of the blast , which closed a major roadway and forced people out of nearby buildings . new york mayor bill de blasio ( d ) said sunday that the explosion was \u201c intentional , \u201d but noted that few details were available because the investigation was in its early stages . \u201c we know there was a bombing , \u201d de blasio said . \u201c we know it was a very serious incident , but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this . \u201d ad ad he also echoed his comments from saturday night that there was no specific , credible threat against new york from any terrorist group . the fbi and nypd are trying to understand what motivation lay behind the blast . \u201c we will look at individuals . we will look at associations . we will look at social media , \u201d william sweeney , assistant director in charge of the fbi new york field office , said . \u201c until we have that information it is not fair for us to give a conclusion ( as to motivation ) , \u201d deblasio said . \u201c let the law enforcement experts draw the conclusions . \u201d police commissioner james o \u2019 neill , whose first day in the position was saturday , told reporters on sunday that police were still gathering evidence . ad \u201c we did find some components indicative of an ied \u2026 that went off intentionally , \u201d o \u2019 neill said . late saturday , police had ruled out natural gas as a possible cause of the blast . ad the new york police department \u2019 s counterterrorism bureau responded to the explosion , along with officials with the fbi and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives . while o \u2019 neill said authorities were still trying to determine what , precisely , exploded , the nypd counterterrorism bureau posted a photo online earlier saturday showing what appeared to be a dumpster or garbage container mangled by a blast : police in new york also reported shortly after 11 p . m . that they had found the \u201c possible secondary device \u201d a few blocks away from the chelsea explosion scene , on 27th street between sixth and seventh avenues . police directed people away from that intersection , and one officer could be heard telling pedestrians that \u201c there is a possible explosive \u201d in the area . ad not long after midnight , police said in a statement that they were asking people in the area of this potential explosive to move away from their windows \u201c until we clear the suspicious package , \u201d although officers did not fully evacuate the area . ad according to the associated press , the second device was removed with a robot and taken to the department firing range in the bronx . o \u2019 neill said sunday that two \u201c very dedicated \u201d former new york state troopers had responded to the initial report of the blast last night . in a search for other explosives , they had parked their vehicle on 27th street . walking down the block , they found the second , unexploded device , o \u2019 neill said . ad reports of another suspicious package at 28th street and fifth avenue turned out to be a false alarm \u2014 the package was only garbage , j . peter donald , a police spokesman , posted on twitter around 12 : 30 a . m . sunday . the chelsea explosion occurred about 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a jersey shore garbage can , shortly before a scheduled charity 5k race there benefiting marines and navy sailors . ad authorities have said they have not yet found anything connecting the chelsea and new jersey incidents but are continuing to investigate . on sunday , cuomo said the \u201c bombs \u201d in chelsea \u201c appear to be different \u201d from those discovered earlier in the day in new jersey , though the devices from both states were being shipped to the fbi lab in quantico for further assessment . he said the devices in new jersey were \u201c pipe bombs , \u201d and those in chelsea were not . cuomo said agents in new york were in touch with those in new jersey . ad cuomo said officials \u201c have no reason to believe at this time that there is any further immediate threat , \u201d though the national guard and the new york state police were deploying an additional 1 , 000 personnel to bus terminals , airports and subways \u201c just to err on the side of caution . \u201d ad cuomo said the blast in chelsea \u201c caused significant property damage , \u201d though he a nearby subway station was structurally safe . he said law enforcement would work diligently to identify and locate those responsible . \u201c whoever placed these bombs , we will find , and they will be brought to justice , \u201d cuomo said . the explosion in the area of 23rd street between sixth and seventh avenues occurred about 8 : 30 p . m . police said . several of those injured were brought to area hospitals , donald , the police spokesman , posted on twitter . ad all victims were treated and released by sunday morning , cuomo said . a spokeswoman for lenox health greenwich village , which treated nine of the victims , said patients were treated for minor injuries that included lacerations to the head and body . other hospitals declined to provide specifics about the extent of patients \u2019 injuries from the explosion . ad photos and accounts posted on social media saturday night showed large crowds \u2014 as well as a large law enforcement presence \u2014 in the area near where the explosion occurred . soleil filomena , 64 , was leaving a convenience store at seventh avenue and 23rd street when she heard the explosion . \u201c it was so loud it just went through my whole body , \u201d she said . \u201c people started running up 23rd street , and i started running with them . \u201d ad filomena said she saw a \u201c big black cloud in the sky . \u201d after the explosion , she said her \u201c ear was ringing for 15 minutes . \u201d when keith salomon of delaware felt the explosion , he was having dinner a block and a half from the site of the blast . his chair and table shook , he said , and he saw people being taken away in ambulances . \u201c we didn \u2019 t know what it was and so , at first , we just kept eating , \u201d said salomon , 52 , who was visiting his son in the city . \u201c but then we realized something was wrong . \u201d others did not hear the explosion but saw the aftermath . when jacob schulman left his apartment a few blocks away shortly before 9 p . m . , he saw people running and screaming . ad \u201c i didn \u2019 t know what was going on , but everyone looked so panicked . i started running . too , \u201d said

simultaneously to kill or maim as many civilians as possible has been a hallmark of militant groups in recent years from iraq to israel and afghanistan and russia . but until monday at the boston marathon finish line in copley square , such street - level bombings targeting sidewalk or marketplace crowds had not taken place on american soil . us law enforcement and intelligence officials across the country and overseas , scrambling to identify the source of the explosives , are now worried that the marathon sidewalk bombing could mark a new chapter in the struggle to secure the american homeland . advertisement \u201c we \u2019 ve seen this around the world , but what is so concerning about this is that it hadn \u2019 t happened here , not like this . until yesterday , \u2019\u2019 said a senior homeland security official in washington . the boston bombs were packed into pressure cookers and hidden in backpacks or duffel bags , according to multiple press accounts citing unidentified sources , another similarity with some mideast attacks using \u201c improvised explosive devices , \u2019\u2019 or ieds . one of the bombs used in a foiled attack in new york \u2019 s times square in 2010 was fashioned from a pressure cooker . a joint warning issued by the fbi and the department of homeland security in 2010 said pressure cookers has been used for bombs in multiple attacks in afghanistan , pakistan , india , and nepal . reports from medical staff at boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with bb \u2019 s , nails , and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage . that contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in oklahoma city in 1995 and in the garage of the world trade center north tower in 1993 , which were intended to inflict damage on buildings , as well as people . ied \u2019 s pack a much smaller punch , are cheaper , and easier to carry . they have been used in iraq and afghanistan with devastating effect on american troops in convoys of military vehicles . advertisement no one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on boylston street that killed three people and injured more than 150 near the boston marathon finish line . a senior us law enforcement official in washington added that the fact that no group has taken responsibility has officials speculating that it might not be the work of a well - known international terrorist group like al qaeda , hezbollah or one of its affiliates but a domestic group or individual inspired by the hallmark tactics of terrorist groups in recent years , the pakistani taliban also said in a statement it was not responsible for the attack , unlike the attempted car bombing in new york \u2019 s times square in 2010 that it claimed responsibility for . but officials in washington have been warning about the possibility of so - called improvised explosive devises in recent weeks . in late february the white house established a new task force housed in the department of justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so - called improvised explosive devices \u2014 some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on boylston street yesterday . \u201c the threat from ied use is likely to remain high in the near future , and will continue to evolve in response to our abilities to counter them , \u2019\u2019 according to a new strategy approved by president obama on february 26 . \u201c a whole - of - government approach that integrates federal , state , local , tribal , territorial , private sector , and global participation in counter - ied activities will best position the united states to discover plots to use ieds in the united states , or against u . s . persons abroad , before those threats become imminent . \u2019\u2019 advertisement the 2010 warning from the fbi and homeland security said \u201c terrorists can exploit the innocuous appearance of easily transportable items such as pressure cookers to conceal ied components . placed carefully , such devices provide little or no indication of an impending attack . \u2019\u2019 \u201c alertness and quick reaction to discovery of such concealment devices in unusual locations or circumstances can improve chances of early detection and prevention of an attack , \u2019\u2019 the warning continued . potential indicators of a pressure cooker configured as an ied include protruding wires or fuses , unusual smells such as chemical odors , and wetness or unusual stains on a container . a magazine published during the last decade by al qaeda provided bomb - making tips that included using pressure cookers . instructions for building such bombs also are contained on other websites , including one site that bills itself as an \u201c anarchist cookbook . \u2019\u2019", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack", "ExplosiveDevice":

) \u2014 japanese police have arrested a man who admitted to landing a drone with low - level radioactive sand on the roof of the prime minister ' s office to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy , officials said saturday . tokyo metropolitan police said yasuo yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late friday in fukui in western japan . the small drone found wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . the infiltration at japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . no one was injured and prime minister shinzo abe was traveling at the time of the incident . police said yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . he has not been indicted and faces further questioning . public broadcaster nhk said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . fukui is home to about a quarter of japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered fukushima plant disaster . abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . the drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . the suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the fukushima dai - ichi meltdowns , nhk said . the government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . drones have become increasingly popular in japan for industrial , service and entertainment use . at a meeting friday , task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones . it is not clear exactly when the drone landed because workers at the office in central tokyo rarely go up to the roof . an official taking new employees on a building tour reportedly spotted the drone . a blog with an anti - nuclear theme managed under the name \" kantei ( prime minister ' s office ) santa \" contained photos of a drone that looked like the one found wednesday . in one entry , the anonymous writer said he drove from his hometown in obama city in fukui to tokyo and flew the drone in the early hours of april 9 , trying to have it land in the yard of the prime minister ' s office , but that he eventually lost track of the device . in the united states in january , a drone flown by an off - duty intelligence employee crashed on the white house grounds .", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Justice.ArrestJailDetain", "Jailer": [[["police"]]], "Detainee": [[["man"]]], "Participant": [],
