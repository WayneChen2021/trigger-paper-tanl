that he set off an explosive device in september on a crowded city street , injuring 30 people . wearing a dark blue jump suit , rahimi , 28 , shuffled slowly into federal court in manhattan and had several coughing fits during the brief hearing . he suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing . he spoke only once , when u . s . district judge richard berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on wednesday . \" yes , sir , \" rahimi said . prosecutors have accused the afghan - born u . s . citizen of setting off an explosion in manhattan ' s chelsea neighborhood on sept . 17 . it did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people . the attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in new jersey , although that detonation did not injure anyone . federal prosecutors also say rahimi left another bomb in chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in elizabeth , new jersey . in addition to the new york indictment , rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in new jersey . he was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in linden , new jersey . the confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in new jersey from a hospital bed . assistant u . s . attorney nicholas lewin told berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing rahimi ' s movements on the day of the bombings , including leaving his house carrying bags , walking on west 23rd street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on west 27th street . he also said the government has records showing rahimi purchased bomb components online and dna evidence tying him to the bombs . lewin asked berman to consider a trial date in the \" late winter \" or \" early spring , \" saying the amount of evidence in the case is relatively limited . berman scheduled court dates for dec . 19 and jan . 31 but has not set a trial date . rahimi ' s court - appointed defense lawyers declined to comment after the hearing .", "templates": [{"Triggers": [["charges"]], "incident_type": "Justice.ChargeIndict", "Defendant":

the august 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people . the court on tuesday indicted bilal mohammed and mieraili yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of erawan shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only bilal and mieraili have been detained . they are described as ethnic uighurs , a minority group based in china ' s xinjiang region . they have been held in custody since their arrests in late august and early september . thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . the august 17 blast at the erawan shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . of the dead , 14 were tourists . the attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others . the two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb . members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer chuchart kanpai . doubts about motive early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of uighur separatists who were angry that thailand in july forcibly repatriated more than 100 uighurs to china , where it is feared they face persecution . the theory was bolstered by the fact that the erawan shrine is popular among chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . but thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . the two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in bangkok because cases of \u201c national security \u201d have been handled by the military since last may , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government . former national police chief somyot poomphanmuang said before his retirement in september that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage , witnesses , dna matching and physical evidence , in addition to their confessions . security camera footage from the erawan shrine showed a man wearing a yellow t - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine , took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away . time stamps on closed circuit tv footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred , during evening rush hour as the area in central bangkok was filled with people . police believe that bilal is the yellow - shirted man who planted the bomb and yusufu is believed to have detonated the bomb . bilal , was initially identified as adem karadag , which was the name on a fake turkish passport in his possession when he was arrested aug . 29 . he was arrested at one of two apartments police raided on the outskirts of bangkok . yusufu was arrested sept . 1 near the thai - cambodia border , carrying a chinese passport indicating he was from xinjiang . police said his dna and fingerprints were found in both raided apartments , including on a container of gunpowder . police said they have confessions from the two , and bilal ' s lawyer says his client admitted planting the deadly bomb at the behest of another suspect who remains a fugitive . he says bilal was induced to carry out the action by a promise that his emigration to turkey would be expedited . some material for this

investigators are particularly interested in any contacts the elder brother , tamerlan tsarnaev , might have had with islamic extremists during a six - month visit to dagestan and chechnya last year .

to him . \u201c what you did to my daughter is disgusting , \u201d she said . \u201c i don ' t know what to say to you . i think the jury did the right thing . \u201d krystle campbell ' s best friend , karen rand mcwatters , who lost a leg in the attack , said tsarnaev \" can ' t possibly have had a soul to do such a horrible thing . \u201d in a message he scrawled in the boat he was found hiding in , tsarnaev said the attack was retaliation against the u . s . for its wars in muslim countries . mcwatters urged tsarnaev to show remorse to discourage other jihadis from killing people in similar attacks . \u201c you can save them from these cowardly acts if you really have an ounce of regret , \u201d she said . rebekah gregory , a texas woman who lost a leg in the bombing , defiantly told tsarnaev she was not his victim . \u201c while your intention was to destroy america , what you have really accomplished is actually quite the opposite \u2014 you ' ve unified us , \u201d she said . \" we are boston strong , we are america strong , and choosing to mess with us was a terrible idea . so how ' s that for your victim impact statement ? \u201d ' he is a leech ' several victims condemned tsarnaev for coming to the u . s . as an immigrant from russia , enjoying the benefits of living here and then attacking american citizens . \u201c he is a leech , abusing the privilege of american freedom , and he spit in the face of the american dream , \u201d said jennifer rogers , an older sister of slain mit officer sean collier . bill richard , whose 8 - year - old son , martin , was the youngest person killed in the bombing , said tsarnaev could have backed out of the plot and reported his brother to authorities . instead , richard said , \u201c he chose hate . he chose destruction . he chose death . this is all on him . \u201d richard noted that his family would have preferred that tsarnaev receive a life sentence so that he could have had \u201c a lifetime to reconcile with himself what he did that day . \u201d richard said his family has chosen love , kindness and peace , adding : \u201c that is what makes us different than him . \u201d fatima tlisova of voa ' s russian service contributed to this report from boston . some information for this report came from reuters and ap .", "templates": [{"Triggers": [["sentenced"]], "incident_type":

used to attack venezuela \u2019 s president analysis of open source information carried out by the investigative website bellingcat suggests drones that had been repurposed as flying bombs were indeed used in an attack on the president of venezuela this weekend . the venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate president nicol\u00e1s maduro using two drones loaded with explosives . the president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred . initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of maduro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . but the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . ap also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim \u2014 suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of maduro \u2019 s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . the venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were dji matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of c4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . dji matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work \u2014 with a u . s . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out \u2014 with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . bellingcat says its analysis supports the government \u2019 s claim that the drone model used was a dji matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors . it also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model , although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed . venezuela \u2019 s interior minister , nestor reverol , also claimed the government thwarted the attack using \" special techniques and ( radio ) signal inhibitors \" , which \" disoriented \" the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand \u2014 a capability bellingcat notes the venezuelan security services are reported to have . the second drone was said by reverol to have \" lost control \" and crashed into a nearby building . bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion . it adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed . \" it is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated , creating the hole in the wall of this apartment , igniting a fire , and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in video 2 ( of the state tv broadcast of maduro \u2019 s speech ) , \" it further suggests . here \u2019 s its conclusion : from the open sources of information available , it appears that an attack took place using two dbieds while maduro was giving a speech . both the drones appear visually similar to dji matrice 600s , with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model . these drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade . the first drone detonated somewhere above or near the parade , the most likely cause of the casualties announced by the venezuelan government and pictured on social media . the second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage , and is the most likely cause of the fire which the venezuelan firefighters described . it also considers the claim of attribution by a group on social media , calling itself \" soldados de franelas \" ( aka \u2018 t - shirt soldiers \u2019 \u2014 a reference to a technique used by protestors wrapping a t - shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity ) , suggesting it \u2019 s not clear from the group \u2019 s twitter messages that they are \" unequivocally claiming responsibility for the event \" , owing to use of passive language , and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government snipers \u2014 which it says \" does not appear to be supported by the open source information available \" .", "templates": [{"Triggers":

international terrorism connection \u201d in the explosion in chelsea , though he stopped short of saying whoever caused the incident did not want to incite terror . ad \u201c it depends on your definition of terrorism , \u201d cuomo said . \u201c a bomb exploding in new york is obviously an act of terrorism , but it \u2019 s not linked to international terrorism . in other words , we find no isis connections . \u201d ad he said later : \u201c this is the nightmare scenario . \u201d not long after the blast , police said they had found another possible explosive device just blocks away . this device appeared to be similar to a pressure cooker and had wiring on it , according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation . pressure cookers were used in the two bombs detonated at the boston marathon in 2013 . the bomb squad safely removed the second device , new york police tweeted early sunday . police officers , firefighters and other first responders had rushed to the scene of the blast , which closed a major roadway and forced people out of nearby buildings . new york mayor bill de blasio ( d ) said sunday that the explosion was \u201c intentional , \u201d but noted that few details were available because the investigation was in its early stages . \u201c we know there was a bombing , \u201d de blasio said . \u201c we know it was a very serious incident , but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this . \u201d ad ad he also echoed his comments from saturday night that there was no specific , credible threat against new york from any terrorist group . the fbi and nypd are trying to understand what motivation lay behind the blast . \u201c we will look at individuals . we will look at associations . we will look at social media , \u201d william sweeney , assistant director in charge of the fbi new york field office , said . \u201c until we have that information it is not fair for us to give a conclusion ( as to motivation ) , \u201d deblasio said . \u201c let the law enforcement experts draw the conclusions . \u201d police commissioner james o \u2019 neill , whose first day in the position was saturday , told reporters on sunday that police were still gathering evidence . ad \u201c we did find some components indicative of an ied \u2026 that went off intentionally , \u201d o \u2019 neill said . late saturday , police had ruled out natural gas as a possible cause of the blast . ad the new york police department \u2019 s counterterrorism bureau responded to the explosion , along with officials with the fbi and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives . while o \u2019 neill said authorities were still trying to determine what , precisely , exploded , the nypd counterterrorism bureau posted a photo online earlier saturday showing what appeared to be a dumpster or garbage container mangled by a blast : police in new york also reported shortly after 11 p . m . that they had found the \u201c possible secondary device \u201d a few blocks away from the chelsea explosion scene , on 27th street between sixth and seventh avenues . police directed people away from that intersection , and one officer could be heard telling pedestrians that \u201c there is a possible explosive \u201d in the area . ad not long after midnight , police said in a statement that they were asking people in the area of this potential explosive to move away from their windows \u201c until we clear the suspicious package , \u201d although officers did not fully evacuate the area . ad according to the associated press , the second device was removed with a robot and taken to the department firing range in the bronx . o \u2019 neill said sunday that two \u201c very dedicated \u201d former new york state troopers had responded to the initial report of the blast last night . in a search for other explosives , they had parked their vehicle on 27th street . walking down the block , they found the second , unexploded device , o \u2019 neill said . ad reports of another suspicious package at 28th street and fifth avenue turned out to be a false alarm \u2014 the package was only garbage , j . peter donald , a police spokesman , posted on twitter around 12 : 30 a . m . sunday . the chelsea explosion occurred about 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a jersey shore garbage can , shortly before a scheduled charity 5k race there benefiting marines and navy sailors . ad authorities have said they have not yet found anything connecting the chelsea and new jersey incidents but are continuing to investigate . on sunday , cuomo said the \u201c bombs \u201d in chelsea \u201c appear to be different \u201d from those discovered earlier in the day in new jersey , though the devices from both states were being shipped to the fbi lab in quantico for further assessment . he said the devices in new jersey were \u201c pipe bombs , \u201d and those in chelsea were not . cuomo said agents in new york were in touch with those in new jersey . ad cuomo said officials \u201c have no reason to believe at this time that there is any further immediate threat , \u201d though the national guard and the new york state police were deploying an additional 1 , 000 personnel to bus terminals , airports and subways \u201c just to err on the side of caution . \u201d ad cuomo said the blast in chelsea \u201c caused significant property damage , \u201d though he a nearby subway station was structurally safe . he said law enforcement would work diligently to identify and locate those responsible . \u201c whoever placed these bombs , we will find , and they will be brought to justice , \u201d cuomo said . the explosion in the area of 23rd street between sixth and seventh avenues occurred about 8 : 30 p . m . police said . several of those injured were brought to area hospitals , donald , the police spokesman , posted on twitter . ad all victims were treated and released by sunday morning , cuomo said . a spokeswoman for lenox health greenwich village , which treated nine of the victims , said patients were treated for minor injuries that included lacerations to the head and body . other hospitals declined to provide specifics about the extent of patients \u2019 injuries from the explosion . ad photos and accounts posted on social media saturday night showed large crowds \u2014 as well as a large law enforcement presence \u2014 in the area near where the explosion occurred . soleil filomena , 64 , was leaving a convenience store at seventh avenue and 23rd street when she heard the explosion . \u201c it was so loud it just went through my whole body , \u201d she said . \u201c people started running up 23rd street , and i started running with them . \u201d ad filomena said she saw a \u201c big black cloud in the sky . \u201d after the explosion , she said her \u201c ear was ringing for 15 minutes . \u201d when keith salomon of delaware felt the explosion , he was having dinner a block and a half from the site of the blast . his chair and table shook , he said , and he saw people being taken away in ambulances . \u201c we didn \u2019 t know what it was and so , at first , we just kept eating , \u201d said salomon , 52 , who was visiting his son in the city . \u201c but then we realized something was wrong . \u201d others did not hear the explosion but saw the aftermath . when jacob schulman left his apartment a few blocks away shortly before 9 p . m . , he saw people running and screaming . ad \u201c i didn \u2019 t know what was going on , but everyone looked so panicked . i started running . too , \u201d said schulman , 26 , who has lived in the neighborhood since 2014 . two blocks from the blast scene , a group of people emerged from a screening of the animated movie \u201c beauty and the beast \u201d and saw the flashing lights . one man who came out of the theater said he could not hear anything and had no idea about the explosion not far from where he was sitting . president obama was briefed on the situation in new york and will be updated as more information becomes available , a white house official said late saturday . speaking in colorado not long after the explosion , republican presidential nominee donald trump quickly commented on the situation before much information was known . \u201c i must tell you that just before i got off the plane , a bomb went off in new york and nobody knows exactly what \u2019 s going on , \u201d said trump shortly after getting off of his plane . his comments were made before authorities confirmed the nature of the explosion . late saturday , democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton said it was important to \u201c know the facts \u201d before drawing conclusions about such incidents . early sunday , posts on social media from people in new york showed the area of the explosion to be relatively calm and quiet . authorities had closed large swaths of roads in the area saturday night . on sunday , several roads had reopened but there remained a large police presence in the area . the explosion in new york comes as foreign leaders , including many heads of state , are heading to manhattan for the united nations general assembly . secretary of state john f . kerry arrived saturday , while obama is scheduled to head to the city on monday . this annual meeting \u2014 held more than two miles from the site of the explosion in chelsea \u2014 is traditionally a challenging time for new york , as many roads are shut down and the heavy security leads to traffic jams . the fbi still has no determination as to motive , said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing . agents are examining the detonated material from the first device as well as studying the second , which appeared to resemble a pressure cooker . they are also looking at video from security cameras , social media \u2014 \u201c all the logical leads , \u201d the official said . the explosion in chelsea coincided with a separate attack that took place in minnesota saturday night , in which a man stabbed eight people in a st . cloud mall before he was killed by an off - duty police officer . on sunday , an isis - linked news agency claimed the mall attacker was \u201c a soldier of the islamic state . \u201d an fbi spokesman said in an emailed statement that the agency had not determined whether the stabbings were related to the bombing in manhattan the same night . speaking to cnn \u2019 s jake tapper on sunday morning , new jersey gov . chris christie ( r ) said there were no known links so far between

"backpack_ied_20", "doctext": "washington \u2014 the threat from multiple homemade bombs detonated nearly simultaneously to kill or maim as many civilians as possible has been a hallmark of militant groups in recent years from iraq to israel and afghanistan and russia . but until monday at the boston marathon finish line in copley square , such street - level bombings targeting sidewalk or marketplace crowds had not taken place on american soil . us law enforcement and intelligence officials across the country and overseas , scrambling to identify the source of the explosives , are now worried that the marathon sidewalk bombing could mark a new chapter in the struggle to secure the american homeland . advertisement \u201c we \u2019 ve seen this around the world , but what is so concerning about this is that it hadn \u2019 t happened here , not like this . until yesterday , \u2019\u2019 said a senior homeland security official in washington . the boston bombs were packed into pressure cookers and hidden in backpacks or duffel bags , according to multiple press accounts citing unidentified sources , another similarity with some mideast attacks using \u201c improvised explosive devices , \u2019\u2019 or ieds . one of the bombs used in a foiled attack in new york \u2019 s times square in 2010 was fashioned from a pressure cooker . a joint warning issued by the fbi and the department of homeland security in 2010 said pressure cookers has been used for bombs in multiple attacks in afghanistan , pakistan , india , and nepal . reports from medical staff at boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with bb \u2019 s , nails , and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage . that contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in oklahoma city in 1995 and in the garage of the world trade center north tower in 1993 , which were intended to inflict damage on buildings , as well as people . ied \u2019 s pack a much smaller punch , are cheaper , and easier to carry . they have been used in iraq and afghanistan with devastating effect on american troops in convoys of military vehicles . advertisement no one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on boylston street that killed three people and injured more than 150 near the boston marathon finish line . a senior us law enforcement official in washington added that the fact that no group has taken responsibility has officials speculating that it might not be the work of a well - known international terrorist group like al qaeda , hezbollah or one of its affiliates but a domestic group or individual inspired by the hallmark tactics of terrorist groups in recent years , the pakistani taliban also said in a statement it was not responsible for the attack , unlike the attempted car bombing in new york \u2019 s times square in 2010 that it claimed responsibility for . but officials in washington have been warning about the possibility of so - called improvised explosive devises in recent weeks . in late february the white house established a new task force housed in the department of justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so - called improvised explosive devices \u2014 some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on boylston street yesterday . \u201c the threat from ied use is likely to remain high in the near future , and will continue to evolve in response to our abilities to counter them , \u2019\u2019 according to a new strategy approved by president obama on february 26 . \u201c a whole - of - government approach that integrates federal , state , local , tribal , territorial , private sector , and global participation in counter - ied activities will best position the united states to discover plots to use ieds in the united states , or against u . s . persons abroad , before those threats become imminent . \u2019\u2019 advertisement the 2010 warning from the fbi and homeland security said \u201c terrorists can exploit the innocuous appearance of easily transportable items such as pressure cookers to conceal ied components . placed carefully , such devices provide little or no indication of an impending attack . \u2019\u2019 \u201c alertness and quick reaction to discovery of such concealment devices in unusual locations or circumstances can improve chances of early detection and prevention of an attack , \u2019\u2019 the warning continued . potential indicators of a pressure cooker configured as an ied include protruding wires or fuses , unusual smells such as chemical odors , and wetness or unusual stains on a container . a magazine published during the last decade by al qaeda provided bomb - making tips that included using pressure cookers . instructions for building such bombs also are contained on other websites , including one site that bills itself as an \u201c anarchist cookbook . \u2019\u2019", "templates": [{"Triggers": [["bombing"]], "incident_type": "Conflict.Attack", "ExplosiveDevice": [[["explosives"]]], "Instrument": [], "Place": [], "Target": [],

"wiki_drone_strikes_0_news_1", "doctext": "there were ten times more air strikes in the covert war on terror during president barack obama \u2019 s presidency than under his predecessor , george w . bush . obama embraced the us drone programme , overseeing more strikes in his first year than bush carried out during his entire presidency . a total of 563 strikes , largely by drones , targeted pakistan , somalia and yemen during obama \u2019 s two terms , compared to 57 strikes under bush . between 384 and 807 civilians were killed in those countries , according to reports logged by the bureau . the use of drones aligned with obama \u2019 s ambition to keep up the war against al qaeda while extricating the us military from intractable , costly ground wars in the middle east and asia . but the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism . the obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so \u201c exceptionally surgical and precise \u201d that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting \u201c innocent men , women and children in danger \u201d . this claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the bureau \u2019 s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . the white house released long - awaited figures last july on the number of people killed in drone strikes between january 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the bureau and other organisations that collect data . however the us \u2019 s estimate of the number of civilians killed \u2013 between 64 and 116 \u2013 contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the bureau , which at 380 to 801 was six times higher . that figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including afghanistan \u2013 where us air attacks have shot up since obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 . the country has since come under frequent us bombardment , in an unreported war that saw 1 , 337 weapons dropped last year alone \u2013 a 40 % rise on 2015 . afghan civilian casualties have been high , with the united nations ( un ) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016 . the bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period . we did not start collecting data on afghanistan until 2015 . pakistan was the hub of drone operations during obama \u2019 s first term . the pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of bush \u2019 s term , after four years pocked by occasional strikes . however in the year after taking office , obama ordered more drone strikes than bush did during his entire presidency . the 54 strikes in 2009 all took place in pakistan .", "templates": [{"Triggers": [["strikes"]],

radioactive sand on the roof of the prime minister ' s office to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy , officials said saturday . tokyo metropolitan police said yasuo yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late friday in fukui in western japan . the small drone found wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . the infiltration at japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . no one was injured and prime minister shinzo abe was traveling at the time of the incident . police said yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . he has not been indicted and faces further questioning . public broadcaster nhk said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . fukui is home to about a quarter of japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered fukushima plant disaster . abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . the drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . the suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the fukushima dai - ichi meltdowns , nhk said . the government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . drones have become increasingly popular in japan for industrial , service and entertainment use . at a meeting friday , task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones . it is not clear exactly when the drone landed because workers at the office in central tokyo rarely go up to the roof . an official taking new employees on a building tour reportedly spotted the drone . a blog with an anti - nuclear theme managed under the name \" kantei ( prime minister ' s office ) santa \" contained photos of a drone that looked like the one found wednesday . in one entry , the anonymous writer said he drove from his hometown in obama city in fukui to tokyo and flew the drone in the early hours of april 9 , trying to have it land in the yard of the prime minister ' s office , but that he eventually lost track of the device . in the united states in january , a drone flown by an off - duty intelligence employee crashed on the white house grounds .", "templates": [{"Triggers":

at the siege of balcombe street . the unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in london and elsewhere in southern england and carrying out several shootings which , along with the

the ira \u2019 s most senior former officers has admitted for the first time that the terror group is responsible for the birmingham pub bombings . kieran conway , who was head of the ira \u2019 s intelligence - gathering department in the 1970s , broke a 40 - year silence by the organisation to make the admission . he admitted he was \u201c appalled and ashamed \u201d because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for . he said the attacks on the mulberry bush and the tavern in the town had been in revenge for the death of ira bomber james mcdade . at first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because \u201c tempers were high \u201d . but he was later told that the ira unit involved had tried to use \u201c a succession of phone boxes \u201d which were out of order , significantly delaying the bomb - warning call . video loading video unavailable click to play tap to play the video will start in 8 cancel play now listen to our recreation of the birmingham pub bombings warning call - made to the birmingham post & mail newsroom conway , who makes the admissions in his new memoir , also revealed that soon after the bombings the ira \u2019 s england operational commander and his adjutant \u201c made it back home \u201d to dublin for an urgent de - brief and to assess the impact of the disaster as far as the terrorists were concerned . birmingham pub bombings : minute by minute - 24 hours that changed our city forever funding for the terrorists dried up almost overnight and the bombings , which left 21 dead and almost 200 injured , including many maimed for life , cost them hugely in the propaganda war . and in an interview he confirmed that the ira hierarchy in dublin knew all along that the six irishmen arrested for the explosions were innocent \u201c from the get go , from the very start . \u201d now , julie and brian hambleton , who lost their sister maxine in the bombings and lead the city \u2019 s justice4the21 campaign , called on west midlands police and david cameron to take immediate action . julie said : \u201c i am expecting west midlands police chief constable chris sims and west midlands police force to interview with mr conway with immediate effect . \u201c and i hope that mr cameron , who a week ago told the house of commons that the pub bombers must be found , takes note of this development and ensures that the police follow this through . \u201d brian added : \u201c the police keep saying they won \u2019 t do anything because there is no fresh evidence . well , here it is in black and white . it \u2019 s an admission . they have got to do something with this information . \u201d the birmingham pub bombings - the 28 numbers that add up to a cover - up , say campaigners mr conway , now a criminal lawyer in dublin , says in the book that where off - duty soldiers were the targets of bombings \u201c i had little sympathy for either the soldiers or the unfortunate civilians who had been sharing their drinking space . \u201d he continued : \u201c the birmingham bombs were another matter . \" the bombings came after british police disrupted funeral arrangements for james mcdade , a volunteer who had himself died in a premature explosion in england . \u201c tempers were high and i , for one , certainly at first feared that the local ira had knowingly caused these dreadful casualties \u2013 21 people were killed and a great many others injured . \u201d \u201c i was appalled and personally ashamed of the bombing , which went against everything we claimed to stand for . \u201d he said he told two other senior ira figures , dave o \u2019 connell and kevin mallon \u201c exactly what i thought \u201d when they met up . \u201c in fact , both men were themselves furious , fully recognising not just the damage the bombing had caused to the ira but its immorality as well . \u201d mcdade , a lieutenant in the birmingham brigade of the ira , blew himself up while trying to plant a bomb at coventry telephone exchange a week before the pub bombings . neither the mulberry bush nor the tavern in the town had any military connection . normal ira procedure at the time for any attack on non - military targets was to give a 30 - minute warning in order for full evacuations to take place . read our docudrama minute - by - minute recreation of the events of november 21 1974 the birmingham mail received an ambiguous call at 8 . 11pm on november 21 . the caller did not identify either pub , referring instead to the rotunda , above the mulberry bush and the new street tax office , which was above the underground tavern in the town . the first bomb destroyed the mulberry bush just six minutes later . the tavern was destroyed at 8 . 27pm . conway was not directly involved in the debrief with the england operational commander . but he said he was later told \u201c that the early indications were that the casualties were the result of yet another failure in the warning system , a succession of phone boxes from which the warning might have been relayed having proved to be inoperable . \u201d in an interview with a national newspaper he described the birmingham pub bombings as \u201c a total disaster . \u201d he added that the secret \u2018 feakle talks \u2019 , held a couple of weeks after the bombings , were used by the ira to try to start to repair its image after the birmingham and the guildford pub bombings . the talks , in feakle , county clare , involved senior ira officials and protestant clergymen and ended abruptly after a tip - off that irish special branch officers were on their way to arrest the republicans . but they set in train a process that eventually led to a brief ceasefire that began on december 22 , 1974 . conway had been recruited in 1970 , having been radicalised during the 1968 student protest movements . he met with senior republicans , including future deputy first minister of northern ireland martin mcguinness and sinn fein president gerry adams . adams continues to deny that he was ever in the ira . conway was later jailed in belfast \u2019

maidan shahr , the capital of maidan wardak province . two gunmen entered the campus right after the explosion and shot at many afghan soldiers before being gunned down during the clashes . defense
