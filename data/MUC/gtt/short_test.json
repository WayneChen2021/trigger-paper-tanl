HOWEVER, IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE FACING THE SAME SITUATION AS BEFORE, THEREFORE, WE HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AND WILL CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS UNTIL A CEASE-FIRE IS AGREED.     IN CARACAS WE COMMITTED OURSELVES TO NEGOTIATING AND HOLDING TALKS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A CEASE-FIRE AND THE NECESSARY AGREEMENTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY AND THE ENTIRE NATION.     THAT IS THE IMPORTANT ISSUE RIGHT NOW.  WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING WITHOUT THAT GOAL, WITHOUT HAVING ANY COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATE ANYTHING.  HOWEVER, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE SITUATION SHOULD REMAIN THE SAME.  NOW THERE IS A NEW FACTOR, A COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATE AND REACH AGREEMENTS ON ALL THOSE TOPICS.  IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE KNOW THE CONTENTS OF THE AGENDA, THAT THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF ALL THE TOPICS TO BE DISCUSSED, AND THAT THEY KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TIMETABLE AGREEMENT FOR DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS.  YOU JOURNALISTS CAN HELP THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND PROBLEM.     [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] COMMANDER, WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE FMLN TO JOIN THE PROCESS?     [HANDAL] LOOK, DEADLINES ARE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS IMPORTANT NOW IS COMPLYING WITH THE AGREEMENTS TO REACH POLITICAL AGREEMENTS.  THAT IS THE MAIN ASPECT OF THE GENEVA AGREEMENT.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME DEADLINES WILL NOT BE MET. IF DEADLINES ARE SET AND THE TIME FOR IMPLEMENTING THEM EXPIRES, THEN THIS IS TANTAMOUNT TO WASTING TIME.  THIS THEN LEADS TO STEPS BEING DEMANDED THAT IN REALITY DEPEND ON THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS THAT ARE REACHED AND NOT THE DEADLINES FOR REACHING THEM.     THEREFORE, ACCORDING TO THE AGENDA AND THE TIMETABLE AGREED TO HERE IN CARACAS, THE ACCENT IS ON THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS.  THOSE AGREEMENTS HAVE TO DO WITH CHANGES WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES. EVERYTHING RELATED TO THE ARMED FORCES MUST BE CHANGED.  EVERY FACTOR CONCERNING THE ARMED FORCES MUST BE REVIEWED FROM A CERTAIN POINT OR PERSPECTIVE.  CHANGES ARE NECESSARY; CHANGES MUST BE MADE AND THOSE CHANGES MUST BE SIGNIFICANT. THESE CHANGES MUST COMPLETELY TRANSFORM THE ARMED FORCES, BEGINNING WITH ITS ROLE AND INFLUENCE IN DETERMINING THE COUNTRY'S POLICIES AND GUIDELINES.     WE HAVE BEEN PRESENTING PROPOSALS IN THIS REGARD FOR SOME TIME. THE TOPIC OF DEMOCRATIZATION IS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE TOPIC OF THE ARMED FORCES, TO ITS PURGING, ITS REDUCTION, AND IN SUM, ITS END.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRY WILL NOT ALWAYS NEED THE ARMED FORCES.  AS WITH ANY INSTITUTION OR HISTORICAL FACTOR, IT EMERGES, IT IS MAINTAINED FOR A CERTAIN TIME, AND THEN IT TENDS TO DISAPPEAR.     THE COUNTRY MUST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP. IT CANNOT CONTINUE ALONG THE SAME PATH BECAUSE THIS WOULD ONLY REPRESENT EXPENSES AND A HEAVY BURDEN FOR THE COUNTRY.     FOR SEVERAL DECADES, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE MEANT ABSENCE OF LIBERTY, REAL SECURITY, AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE CIVILIAN SOCIETY TO DECIDE THE COUNTRY'S PATH.  ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO A MERE FORMALITY, WHERE THOSE WHO WERE NOT ELECTED RUN THE COUNTRY.     THE COUNTRY IS NOW GOING THROUGH A DRAMA THAT HAS ALSO SHOCKED THE INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC, THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.  EVERYONE IS AWAITING THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS AND HOPING THAT THOSE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CRIME WILL BE PUNISHED.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASE OF JESUIT PRIESTS IS REALLY GRAVE; IT IS A DRAMA THAT REFLECTS THE DRAMA OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S HISTORY IN THE CURRENT CENTURY. [CONTINUED]"

THE TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED THAT SOME MILITARY WERE REPORTEDLY INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS, WHICH TOOK PLACE AT DAYBREAK ON 16 NOVEMBER, AS REPORTED BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON 7 JANUARY.     \"THE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN REST ASSURED THE SALVADORAN JUDICIARY SYSTEM WILL NOT HESITATE TO ENFORCE THE LAW UPON THE AUTHORS OF THIS HORRIBLE CRIME,\" DR GUTIERREZ POINTED OUT.     GUTIERREZ SAID HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED OR THEIR MILITARY RANKS, BECAUSE THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS IS STILL CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS AND HAS NOT PRESENTED ITS REPORT TO THE TRIBUNAL.     HOWEVER, GENERAL PROSECUTOR DR MAURICIO EDUARDO COLORADO MAINTAINED THAT THE MILITARY SUSPECTS \"ARE REGROUPED AND HAVE BEEN PUT IN CUSTODY.\" HOWEVER, HE DID NOT REVEAL THE NAMES OR THE MILITARY RANKS OF THE SUSPECTS.     THE PROSECUTOR SAID THAT THE SCIENTIFIC TEST CONDUCTED BY THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS AND THE SPECIALIZED POLICE WORKING ON THIS CASE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE CRIME COULD HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED BY ARMED FORCES MEMBERS.     \"THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE WILL PROCEED ACCORDING TO THE LAW AND AGAINST WHOEVER TURNS OUT TO BE GUILTY, BECAUSE IT IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE,\" COLORADO SAID.     ASKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE, JUSTICE MINISTER DR OSCAR ALFREDO SANTAMARIA, PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS SAID: \"WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION ON THIS CASE WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC A FEW DAYS AGO.\"  HE REFUSED TO MAKE ANY FURTHER STATEMENTS.     NEW UCA [CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] RECTOR JESUIT FRANCISCO ESTRADA ADMITTED PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS TAKEN \"A STEP FORWARD\" BY UNMASKING THE SUSPECTS IN THIS CRIME, \"BECAUSE HIS ETHIC PRINCIPLES DO NOT TOLERATE SUCH ATROCITIES.\"     ESTRADA SAID HE UNDERSTANDS WHY CRISTIANI, DURING HIS 7 JANUARY SPEECH, DID NOT GIVE ANY NAMES, \"BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL BEING CONDUCTED.\"  MOREOVER, THERE MUST NOT ONLY BE ONE SUSPECT, BUT RATHER SEVERAL.\"     BEFORE MEETING WITH THE REPORTERS, THE UCA RECTOR MET WITH OFFICIALS FROM SCOTLAND YARD.  A FEW DAYS AGO, HE ALSO MET SPANISH, CANADIAN, AND U.S.  POLICEMEN WHO, AT THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST, ARE ASSISTING THE SALVADORAN COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF CLARIFYING THIS CASE."

THE DIRCOTE [COUNTERTERRORISM DIVISON] HAS IDENTIFIED ONE OF THE TERRORISTS AS GERARDO OLIVOS SILVA THROUGH A COMPOSITE MADE FROM WITNESS' REPORTS.  THE POLICE SAY THAT OLIVOS SILVA, A FORESTRY ENGINEER, HAS PARTICIPATED IN OTHER ATTACKS AGAINST ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL IN THE PAST.     LOPEZ ALBUJAR'S MURDER HAS MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION IN PERU.  ACCORDING TO POLITICAL OBSERVERS, THE INCIDENT IS BEING REGARDED AS AN INDICATION THAT THE SHINING PATH INTENDS TO CONTINUE ITS TERRORIST ATTACKS TO INTIMIDATE THE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE UPCOMING GENERAL ELECTION ON 8 APRIL.     SOME 1600 PERUVIANS WERE MURDERED DURING THE LAST QUARTER OF 1989 DUE TO THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE SURROUNDING THE 12 NOVEMBER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS."

ACCORDING TO A DIJIN REPORT, THE POLICE INFILTRATED THE INNER STRUCTURE OF THE CAMILO ZAPATA VASQUEZ FAMILY.  THE NOTICIERO DE LAS SIETE NEWSCAST MANAGED TO SHOOT VIDEO FOOTAGE OF THE RAID ON THE LA MARIA FARM ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF BOGOTA.  HERE IS EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE AND A REPORT BY WILLIAM CALDERON:     [BEGIN RECORDING] [CALDERON] ANONYMOUS CALLERS INFORMED THE AUTHORITIES ABOUT LA MARIA FARM, A LUXURIOUS RANCH LOCATED NEAR ASUBA, A FEW KILOMETERS FROM BOGOTA.  AT 1900, A GOES [SPECIAL OPERATIONS GROUP] TEAM SURROUNDED THE RANCH.  AN AGENT MAKES SURE THE MAIN GATE IS NOT ELECTRICALLY WIRED, AND THE DECISION TO FORCIBLY ENTER THE HOUSE IS MADE. THEY ALL COVER ONE ANOTHER AS THEY TAKE THEIR POSITIONS.  THESE MEN ARE PERFECTLY TRAINED FOR THIS SORT OF WORK.  THESE IS A LIGHT INSIDE THE RANCH HOUSE, SO THEY ASSUME SOMEONE IS INSIDE.  TENSION RISES IN VIEW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ARMED CONFRONTATION.  AS HE APPROACHES THE RANCH, THE COMMANDER DECIDES TO STORM IT.  MOMENTS LATER, SEVERAL MEN OPEN THE DOOR WITHOUT OFFERING RESISTANCE AND SURRENDER TO THE AUTHORITIES.     A PATROL ENTERS QUICKLY AND CONTROLS EVERY CORNER OF THE RANCH.  OTHER UNIFORMED MEN SUPPORT THE OPERATION FROM OUTSIDE.  THEY UNSUCCESSFULLY LOOK FOR CACHES.  THESE THREE WORKERS WHO WERE DOING REPAIRS AT THE RANCH WERE DETAINED AS A PRECAUTION IN THE MAIN HALL.  MEANWHILE, THE SEARCH CONTINUES IN OTHER AREAS OF THE HOUSE.  THREE SAFES WERE HIDDEN IN DIFFERENT ROOMS OF THE RANCH HOUSE.  ONE OF THE SAFES WAS BUILT INTO ONE OF THE EIGHT MARBLE-TILED BATHROOMS.  THE HUGE KITCHEN WAS TEMPORARILY AT THE WORKERS' DISPOSAL.  NEAR THE MASTER BEDROOM WAS A LARGE SWIMMING POOL WITH A GROUND-LEVEL WINDOW FROM THE SAUNA AND JACUZZI AREA.  THERE WERE SEVERAL GAME ROOMS AND TENNIS AND SQUASH COURTS IN THE HOUSE.     THE AUTHORITIES NOW HAVE DOCUMENTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS, ALTHOUGH THE RESIDENTS OF THIS LUXURY RANCH HAD LEFT BEFORE THE RAID.       NINETEEN OTHER OPERATIONS WERE SIMULTANEOULSY CONDUCTED IN BOGOTA.  THE AUTHORITIES SAID AFTERWARD THAT THEY FELT THEY HAD DISMANTLED THE BOGOTA CARTEL.     THE DIJIN RELEASED THE FOLLOWING REPORT: 10 PERSONS ARRESTED, INCLUDING JESUS EVELIO ZAPATA LOPEZ, THE ALLEGED HEAD OF THIS DRUG TRAFFICKING BAND THAT HAD INTERNATIONAL CONNECTIONS.     THE FOLLOWING WAS SEIZED: 3 CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT WORTH ALMOST 250 MILLION PESOS; 1 1977 PORSCHE SIMILAR TO THE ONE SEIZED FROM JORGE LUIS OCHOA IN 1988; 3 TOYOTAS, ONE OF WHICH WAS SOLD 4 MONTHS AGO BY AN ECUADORAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL IN BOGOTA; 3 REVOLVERS; 3 PISTOLS; 1 CARBINE; AMMUNITION; RADIO COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT; 2 FALSE DIPLOMATIC LICENCE PLATES; AND CASH.

ORDONEZ REYES ACCUSED JOSE JESUS PENA--ALLEGED CHIEF OF SECURITY FOR THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA--OF MASTERMINDING THE 7 JANUARY ASSASSINATION OF CONTRA COMMANDER MANUEL ANTONIO RUGAMA.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [MEMBRENO] WE CATEGORICALLY DENY THAT ALLEGATION. THESE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE EMBASSY ARE RIDICULOUS.  THE EMBASSY HAS NO OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE WITH THE NAME OF THE MAN IDENTIFIED IN THE NEWS CONFERENCE.  THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN MANY ACCOUNTS OF THIS INCIDENT THAT POINT TO THE COUNTERREVOLUTION.  WE CATEGORICALLY DENY THESE ACCUSATIONS AND CHARACTERIZE THEM AS RIDICULOUS.  WE HAVE NO SECURITY OFFICERS AT THIS EMBASSY, ONLY DIPLOMATIC AND SUPPORT PERSONNEL. [END RECORDING]     [ALVAREZ] ALL THE PERSONNEL WHO WORK AT THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA ARE APPOINTED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, ACCORDING TO THE COUNSELOR.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [MEMBRENO] ALL OUR PERSONNEL ARE NICARAGUANS.  IN REGARD TO WHAT HE [ORDONEZ REYES] HAS INVENTED, WE THINK IT IS RIDICULOUS.  WE ONLY HAVE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL WORKING AT THE EMBASSY. [END RECORDING]     [ALVAREZ] REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY THAT COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY AGENTS INFILTRATED THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA, COUNSELOR JUAN JOSE MEMBRENO REPLIED:     [BEGIN RECORDING] [MEMBRENO] THIS HAPPENED AT THE AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.  THE AMBASSADOR LEARNED BY CHANCE THAT ONE OF THE RESIDENCE GUARDS WAS OF NICARAGUAN ORIGIN WITH ALLEDGED COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY LINKS. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.  THIS CASE DID NOT OCCUR AT THE EMBASSY.     [ALVAREZ] IS MANAGUA INTERESTED IN ELIMINATING ALL THE CONTRA LEADERS LIVING IN HONDURAS OR ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE LINKED TO THE COUNTERREVOLUTION?     [MEMBRENO] ON THE CONTRARY, WE RESPECT PEOPLES' LIVES AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO RECEIVE IN NICARAGUA ALL NICARAGUANS WHO WANT TO ACCEPT AMNESTY AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE IN ONE WAY OR OTHER BEEN INVOLVED IN THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY CAMPAIGN.     [ALVAREZ] HAVE THERE BEEN ANY MORE ATTACKS AGAINST THIS EMBASSY OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF THREAT, AS OCCURRED A FEW DAYS AGO?     [MEMBRENO] NO, AFTER THE SHOOTING INCIDENT AT THE AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, WHAT HAPPENED A FEW DAYS LATER--HERE AT THE EMBASSY--WAS THAT A CAR DROVE PAST THE EMBASSY AT NIGHT AND KNOCKED DOWN SOME SECURITY RAILS ON THE SIDEWALK.
