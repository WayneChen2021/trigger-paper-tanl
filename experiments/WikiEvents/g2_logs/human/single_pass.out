venezuela ’ s beleaguered government appeared prepared to go ahead with a vote on sunday that critics at home and abroad have warned will seal the demise of the oil - rich nation ’ s democracy . at least five people were killed last week after the opposition stepped up its protests against the controversial vote that will elect a 545 - member constituent assembly with the power to rewrite the constitution and dissolve state institutions . a government ban on public demonstrations in the run - up to the election reduced turnouts for nationwide protests called by the opposition , but sporadic looting and clashes between protesters manning barricades of tree branches and barbed wire were reported in several cities on friday night . q & a why is there unrest in venezuela ? show • at the heart of the crisis is a cratering economy and acute shortages of medicine and food , coupled with rising anger at a soaring crime rate and an increasingly authoritarian government • the president , nicolás maduro , won a general election in 2013 on a platform of continuing his predecessor hugo chávez ' s socialist policies of using the country ' s oil riches to reduce inequality and lift people out of poverty , but falling oil prices have forced the government to curtail social programmes • opposition activists have been staging unrelenting protests against the government . despite the continuing threat of repression , the opposition coalition , known as mud , called for mass demonstrations in caracas on sunday while voting takes place . “ tomorrow we rebel , ” tweeted freddy guevara , vice - president of the opposition - held national legislature , whose power to legislate was hamstrung by a supreme court decision in april , prompting the protests . at least 113 people have been killed , and more than 2 , 000 wounded , in constant street protests since april , triggering president nicolás maduro ’ s decision to create the assembly . maduro has said the assembly will help bring peace to the sharply divided country where , despite its oil wealth , many venezuelans are going hungry because of food shortages and spiralling inflation . but the opposition said it is little more than a power grab to consolidate the ruling socialist party ’ s grip . it is boycotting the assembly and demanding general elections instead . “ on 30 july , the constitutional assembly will happen , ” maduro said . “ i ’ ve been loyal to chávez ’ s legacy . now it ’ s your turn . ” an attempt at brokering an agreement by the former prime minister of spain , josé luis rodriguez zapatero , to avert the increased tensions appeared to have failed . zapatero issued a statement on saturday tacitly acknowledging that the constituent assembly vote would be held , but calling on the assembly ’ s powers to be limited and for firm dates for local and presidential elections to be set . “ today and tomorrow are transcendental for venezuela , ” zapatero said in the statement . he called on the government to make “ new gestures ” to help ease tensions but did not call for the vote to be cancelled . the opposition also appeared resigned to seeing the vote take place . “ but we are not backing down because our problem is not the constituent assembly , it is the dictatorship , ” said guevara in a statement . “ what comes after sunday will not be easy for us , ” he said , adding however that the “ deepening of the crisis will affect those in government much more ” . but polls show that 70 % of venezuelans do not want a constituent assembly , although turnout on sunday may not reflect that . to avoid an embarrassingly low turnout , government officials and pro - government neighbourhood committees have been warning that people who do not show up for the vote may lose their jobs , essential food subsidies or homes . delcy leonor medina , a 52 - year - old housekeeper , said she and her neighbours in a working - class district of caracas face the threat of armed muggings and murders . now they face an added threat of losing their government - subsidised homes if they don ’ t vote . but she remained defiant . “ i ’ m not giving that bastard anything . if the constituent assembly is voted in , i may have to leave here , ” she said . many of venezuela ’ s 2 . 8 million state workers have reported getting text messages , phone calls and being required to attend political rallies during work hours , according to reuters . early on saturday , the opposition coalition ’ s website appeared to have been hacked , showing a message saying “ yanquis , leave our america ” with a photo of the us president , donald trump . hours later , the site showed a message reading “ democracy can not be hacked . ” cilia flores , maduro ’ s wife and a candidate for the assembly , said the new body with supra - legislative powers would create a commission to punish those responsible for the political upheaval . they will “ pay and learn their lesson ” , she said , playing on the fears of the opposition that they will suffer further persecution . diosdado cabello , the first vice - president of venezuela ’ s socialist party , said the assembly will strip legislators in the opposition - controlled national assembly of their immunity from prosecution . he said the office of venezuela ’ s chief prosecutor , who recently became one of maduro ’ s most outspoken critics , would be “ turned upside down ” . the us has led other nations in imposing targeted sanctions against 13 current and former officials close to the government . they were followed by similar measures by mexico and colombia . us vice - president mike pence spoke by phone with opposition leader and political prisoner leopoldo lópez , sentenced to 14 years for inciting violence , charges human rights groups have said were trumped up . pence told lópez , who was transferred to house arrest earlier this month , that the united states “ stands with the venezuelan people ” . the trump administration has threatened further measures if the vote goes ahead , which may target the country ’ s oil industry , one of the few economic lifelines left in venezuela . colombia ’ s president juan manuel santos , who is often the target of maduro ’ s public rants of an international conspiracy against him , said he would not recognise the constituent assembly , which he called “ spurious ” . in a tacit recognition of the growing humanitarian and political crisis , the colombian government said on friday it was granting a special permit for venezuelans already in the country to remain for up to two years . and more than one venezuelan is preparing to pack his bags and join the growing number of people fleeing . carlos , a 24 -

the twin towers ; deadly bomb was cheap and easily made , experts say the bomb that savaged the world trade center , investigators and explosive experts said yesterday , apparently was put together with ordinary chemicals that are widely and cheaply available at chemical supply houses and gardening centers throughout the country . experts now estimate that the bomb weighed about 1 , 000 pounds and that the chemicals to make it were bought for a little more than $ 400 . though a young chemical engineer was arrested yesterday in connection with the explosion , the experts say that such a bomb could have been made by almost anyone with the help of one of scores of manuals , obtainable in bookstores and libraries , that provide step - by - step instructions .

thai authorities indict 2 over august shrine attack a bangkok military court has indicted two men accused of carrying out the august 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people . the court on tuesday indicted bilal mohammed and mieraili yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of erawan shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only bilal and mieraili have been detained . they are described as ethnic uighurs , a minority group based in china ' s xinjiang region . they have been held in custody since their arrests in late august and early september . thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . the august 17 blast at the erawan shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . of the dead , 14 were tourists . the attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others . the two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb . members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer chuchart kanpai . doubts about motive early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of uighur separatists who were angry that thailand in july forcibly repatriated more than 100 uighurs to china , where it is feared they face persecution . the theory was bolstered by the fact that the erawan shrine is popular among chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . but thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . the two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last may , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government . former national police chief somyot poomphanmuang said before his retirement in september that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage , witnesses , dna matching and physical evidence , in addition to their confessions . security camera footage from the erawan shrine showed a man wearing a yellow t - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine , took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away . time stamps on closed circuit tv footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred , during evening rush hour as the area in central bangkok was filled with people . police believe that bilal is the yellow - shirted man who planted the bomb and yusufu is believed to have detonated the bomb . bilal , was initially identified as adem karadag , which was the name on a fake turkish passport in his possession when he was arrested aug . 29 . he was arrested at one of two apartments police raided on the outskirts of bangkok . yusufu was arrested sept . 1 near the thai - cambodia border , carrying a chinese passport indicating he was from xinjiang . police said his dna and fingerprints were found in both raided apartments , including on a container of gunpowder . police said they have confessions from the two , and bilal ' s lawyer says his client admitted planting the deadly bomb at the behest of another suspect who remains a fugitive . he says bilal was induced to carry out the action by a promise that his emigration to turkey would be expedited . some material for this report came from ap .

analysis backs claim drones were used to attack venezuela ’ s president analysis of open source information carried out by the investigative website bellingcat suggests drones that had been repurposed as flying bombs were indeed used in an attack on the president of venezuela this weekend . the venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate president nicolás maduro using two drones loaded with explosives . the president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred . initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of maduro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . but the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . ap also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of maduro ’ s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . the venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were dji matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of c4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . dji matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work — with a u . s . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a dji matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors . it also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model , although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed . venezuela ’ s interior minister , nestor reverol , also claimed the government thwarted the attack using " special techniques and ( radio ) signal inhibitors " , which " disoriented " the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand — a capability bellingcat notes the venezuelan security services are reported to have . the second drone was said by reverol to have " lost control " and crashed into a nearby building . bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion . it adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed . " it is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated , creating the hole in the wall of this apartment , igniting a fire , and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in video 2 ( of the state tv broadcast of maduro ’ s speech ) , " it further suggests . here ’ s its conclusion : from the open sources of information available , it appears that an attack took place using two dbieds while maduro was giving a speech . both the drones appear visually similar to dji matrice 600s , with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model . these drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade . the first drone detonated somewhere above or near the parade , the most likely cause of the casualties announced by the venezuelan government and pictured on social media . the second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage , and is the most likely cause of the fire which the venezuelan firefighters described . it also considers the claim of attribution by a group on social media , calling itself " soldados de franelas " ( aka ‘ t - shirt soldiers ’ — a reference to a technique used by protestors wrapping a t - shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity ) , suggesting it ’ s not clear from the group ’ s twitter messages that they are " unequivocally claiming responsibility for the event " , owing to use of passive language , and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government snipers — which it says " does not appear to be supported by the open source information available " .
