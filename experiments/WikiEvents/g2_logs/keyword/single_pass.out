government opponents are begging venezuelans to sit out a vote on sunday for what they see as a puppet congress and the last step toward dictatorship in this south american country . but josé , a caracas bus driver , said he and other public transit employees were given an ultimatum by their bosses . turn out and vote for the new congress , in an election in which nearly every candidate is a supporter of president nicolás maduro . or else . “ they ’ re obliging us to vote , ” said the young father of two , who declined to give his last name , fearing repercussions . “ if not , they ’ ll fire us , and what are we going to do without a job ? ” venezuela is not yet the kind of dictatorship that once proliferated in latin america — with rulers who “ disappeared ” opponents , banned books and movies , and ran mass torture centers . government pressure and violence against journalists have drastically curbed the press , but digital media outlets thrive . hundreds of political prisoners are in jail , according to human rights groups , but opposition leaders continue to forcefully speak out . this month , the government allowed one major critic — leopoldo lópez , the former mayor of caracas — to exchange his jail cell for house arrest . 1 of 46 full screen autoplay close skip ad × protesters clash with venezuelan security forces view photos thousands have been arrested , and many allege mistreatment . caption people took to the streets to either vote in or boycott a controversial election to choose members of an all - powerful constituent assembly . aug . 7 , 2017 pro - government supporters holding venezuela ’ s flag march in caracas . ueslei marcelino / reuters buy photo wait 1 second to continue . yet on sunday , critics say , an authoritarian system long in the making will be formalized , reviving memories of an era that the region had hoped was over . in defiance of international warnings , the socialist government is pushing forward with a vote to elect a constituent assembly that will have the authority to change the 1999 constitution , supplant the opposition - controlled legislature and potentially keep maduro in power indefinitely . the opposition on thursday called for three days of massive , nationwide protests as the government showed no willingness to back down and following the slaying of seven more demonstrators in two days . responding to the spiraling tensions , the u . s . state department ordered the departure of family members of american staff at its embassy in caracas . it also authorized voluntary departures for american staff , and issued a broad travel warning for u . s . citizens . maduro — the anointed successor of firebrand leader hugo chávez , who died in 2013 — strongly defends the new assembly , saying it will fortify what he hails as “ the communal state . ” while it ’ s unclear exactly what he is seeking in a new constitution , it would likely give more power to “ communal councils ” in poor neighborhoods . leaders of those councils , critics say , are government loyalists who in practice would sideline elected politicians and win direct pipelines to government funds . on the surface , the assembly vote , along with the government ’ s pseudo - soviet speak , hark back to old - school marxist regimes . but many here see something perhaps more sinister emerging — a 21st - century thugocracy that rules by coercion , extortion and violence . about 100 people have died in three months of anti - government street protests . arrests of political activists have accelerated . bands of pro - government toughs — known as colectivos — roam poor neighborhoods , waving guns , intimidating protesters and journalists , beating opposition politicians , and warning locals to toe the government line . ( how a new kind of protest movement has arisen in venezuela ) more than 7 million people voted against the establishment of the new assembly in an informal referendum july 16 . opposition parties are boycotting the election . in a country where the government is the largest employer , state workers say they are being ordered to vote sunday , at the risk of losing their jobs . hiv patients say officials have threatened to cut off their supplies of antiretroviral drugs if they do not turn out for the election . families risk being scratched off government food distribution rosters for not showing up — a dire outcome in a country where a socialist experiment and economic mismanagement have sparked hyperinflation and food shortages . such threats are not idle , either . yanelis banco , 36 years old and nearly nine months pregnant , said her boss at the government postal service called her in along with other department heads for a talk last week . he ordered them , she said , to sign a form pledging to vote sunday . she and five other senior staffers refused . all of them lost their jobs , she said . “ i ’ m a pregnant woman who has been working in the company for 10 years and four months , so i didn ’ t think they ’ d fire me , ” she said . “ why do i have to sign if i don ’ t agree ? i thought the law protected me ! ” she added : “ all the other employees are terrified . now they ’ re sure that if they don ’ t vote , they ’ ll be fired . none of them can afford that . ” ( stuck in a death spiral , venezuela is borrowing money at any cost ) maduro has acknowledged that the government is pressuring public employees to vote . at a rally with public energy workers this month , he said : “ take the lists of workers from all the state institutions and businesses to create a constituent committee . for each business , call all the workers and organize how they ’ ll vote on july 30th . at the end of the day , check the list . if there are 15 , 000 workers , there have to be 15 , 000 votes , with no excuses . ” venezuela ’ s political protests have been fueled by the disastrous state of the economy , growing authoritarian rule and the government ’ s resistance to early elections . the country ’ s electoral council ruled against the opposition when it sought a referendum in 2016 that could have cut short maduro ’ s six - year term . the council also pushed back elections for governors , scheduled for 2016 , to december of this year . critics fear that the new assembly will cancel those , as well as the presidential election in 2018 . the u . s . treasury department in february froze vice president tareck el aissami ’ s american assets over his alleged involvement in narcotics trafficking and took similar action against eight justices of the pro - government supreme court after it tried to strip power from the opposition - led legislature . on wednesday , the trump administration targeted 13 more venezuelan officials , alleging violations of human rights and corruption . ( trump administration hits 13 venezuelans with sanctions in advance of vote ) once the richest country per capita in south america due to its vast oil reserves , venezuela was also cursed with vast disparities that kept an elite in luxury while the poor languished in slums . the result was chávez , who used the petroleum wealth to launch massive social programs , even as he concentrated power . he remains much beloved by millions of venezuelans , although many others — especially in the middle and upper classes — loathe him . maduro ’ s approval rating , on the other hand , is hovering around 20 percent , with opponents calling this weekend ’ s vote the only way for him to remain in the presidential palace . he has promised venezuelans that the assembly will herald a new era of security and stability . “ july 30th will be the birth of a historic trigger of the homeland for a new phase of peace and advancement , ” maduro told a campaign rally this week . yet many venezuelans fear just the opposite — a deepening of official repression . it is already starting , they say . take , for instance , 51 - year - old lisbeth añez , or “ mama lis . ” for years , she was known for aiding anti - government protesters , bringing them blankets and cooking them fresh arepas , or cornmeal cakes . in may , she was arrested and charged with treason . her case is in the hands of a military tribunal . in recent months , scores of civilians who have taken part in demonstrations or other perceived anti - government acts have been sent into the military court system , where they can face lengthy prison sentences . “ i can ’ t sleep , i can ’ t eat , even if we had enough food , ” said her son , luis gonzález añez , 23 , who said he was refused entry to her trial . “ i have nightmares , thinking about her in jail . . . i didn ’ t think things could get worse , but they have . ” gabriela ramírez , venezuela ’ s former public ombudsman and a longtime chávez supporter , said she feared the government would become worse than a dictatorship . “ we will have a narco - authoritarian regime , ” she said . ramírez , who carries around a pocket version of chávez ’ s 1999 constitution in her purse , is among the ranks of former “ chavistas ” — or chávez backers — who have turned against maduro . she has paid for it with harassment , she said , including a recent hack in which intimate photos of her and her husband were leaked on social media . “ there will no longer be any check on their power , ” she said . “ they will control everything . ” following an opposition - called 48 - hour strike , the government on thursday issued a ban on public gatherings and protests lasting from friday through tuesday . the opposition responded by calling for nationwide mobilization , asking citizens to take to the streets from the caribbean sea to the andes mountains . in an interview , freddy guevara , an opposition leader and vice president of the national assembly , played down the chances of any deal to suspend or cancel the vote . former spanish prime minister josé luis rodríguez zapatero is in caracas , and has served as an intermediary between the government and opposition . guevara denied reports that a deal had been offered to suspend the vote . “ it is wishful thinking , ” he said . “ i am sure they are going forward with this scam , and that we are going to respond with pressure . ” but even leading members of the opposition appear to be losing hope that maduro will back down . scenarios for what happens next range widely . some observers suggest that social unrest and international sanctions will worsen , prompting , perhaps , a military coup or fueling an anti - government guerrilla movement . others say the government , likely with the aid of russia and china , will somehow manage to hold on as the country becomes an international pariah . still others see a worst - case scenario of social implosion and anarchy . “ somalia , ” said henrique capriles , an opposition leader and governor of the state of miranda . “ we could become a failed state . ” mariana zuñiga contributed to this report . read more things are so bad in venezuela that people are rationing toothpaste venezuela ’ s paradox : people are hungry , but farmers can ’ t feed them maduro wants to rewrite the constitution . that ’ s rocket fuel on the fire . today ’ s coverage from post correspondents around the world like washington post world on facebook and stay updated on foreign news

thai authorities indict 2 over august shrine attack a bangkok military court has indicted two men accused of carrying out the august 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people . the court on tuesday indicted bilal mohammed and mieraili yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of erawan shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only bilal and mieraili have been detained . they are described as ethnic uighurs , a minority group based in china ' s xinjiang region . they have been held in custody since their arrests in late august and early september . thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . the august 17 blast at the erawan shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . of the dead , 14 were tourists . the attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others . the two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb . members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer chuchart kanpai . doubts about motive early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of uighur separatists who were angry that thailand in july forcibly repatriated more than 100 uighurs to china , where it is feared they face persecution . the theory was bolstered by the fact that the erawan shrine is popular among chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . but thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . the two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last may , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government . former national police chief somyot poomphanmuang said before his retirement in september that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage , witnesses , dna matching and physical evidence , in addition to their confessions . security camera footage from the erawan shrine showed a man wearing a yellow t - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine , took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away . time stamps on closed circuit tv footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred , during evening rush hour as the area in central bangkok was filled with people . police believe that bilal is the yellow - shirted man who planted the bomb and yusufu is believed to have detonated the bomb . bilal , was initially identified as adem karadag , which was the name on a fake turkish passport in his possession when he was arrested aug . 29 . he was arrested at one of two apartments police raided on the outskirts of bangkok . yusufu was arrested sept . 1 near the thai - cambodia border , carrying a chinese passport indicating he was from xinjiang . police said his dna and fingerprints were found in both raided apartments , including on a container of gunpowder . police said they have confessions from the two , and bilal ' s lawyer says his client admitted planting the deadly bomb at the behest of another suspect who remains a fugitive . he says bilal was induced to carry out the action by a promise that his emigration to turkey would be expedited . some material for this report came from ap .

analysis backs claim drones were used to attack venezuela ’ s president analysis of open source information carried out by the investigative website bellingcat suggests drones that had been repurposed as flying bombs were indeed used in an attack on the president of venezuela this weekend . the venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate president nicolás maduro using two drones loaded with explosives . the president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred . initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of maduro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . but the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . ap also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of maduro ’ s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . the venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were dji matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of c4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . dji matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work — with a u . s . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a dji matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors . it also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model , although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed . venezuela ’ s interior minister , nestor reverol , also claimed the government thwarted the attack using " special techniques and ( radio ) signal inhibitors " , which " disoriented " the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand — a capability bellingcat notes the venezuelan security services are reported to have . the second drone was said by reverol to have " lost control " and crashed into a nearby building . bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion . it adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed . " it is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated , creating the hole in the wall of this apartment , igniting a fire , and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in video 2 ( of the state tv broadcast of maduro ’ s speech ) , " it further suggests . here ’ s its conclusion : from the open sources of information available , it appears that an attack took place using two dbieds while maduro was giving a speech . both the drones appear visually similar to dji matrice 600s , with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model . these drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade . the first drone detonated somewhere above or near the parade , the most likely cause of the casualties announced by the venezuelan government and pictured on social media . the second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage , and is the most likely cause of the fire which the venezuelan firefighters described . it also considers the claim of attribution by a group on social media , calling itself " soldados de franelas " ( aka ‘ t - shirt soldiers ’ — a reference to a technique used by protestors wrapping a t - shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity ) , suggesting it ’ s not clear from the group ’ s twitter messages that they are " unequivocally claiming responsibility for the event " , owing to use of passive language , and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government snipers — which it says " does not appear to be supported by the open source information available " .

new york gov . andrew cuomo ( d ) said sunday that there is “ no evidence of an international terrorism connection ” in the explosion in chelsea , though he stopped short of saying whoever caused the incident did not want to incite terror . ad “ it depends on your definition of terrorism , ” cuomo said . “ a bomb exploding in new york is obviously an act of terrorism , but it ’ s not linked to international terrorism . in other words , we find no isis connections . ” ad he said later : “ this is the nightmare scenario . ” not long after the blast , police said they had found another possible explosive device just blocks away . this device appeared to be similar to a pressure cooker and had wiring on it , according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation . pressure cookers were used in the two bombs detonated at the boston marathon in 2013 . the bomb squad safely removed the second device , new york police tweeted early sunday . police officers , firefighters and other first responders had rushed to the scene of the blast , which closed a major roadway and forced people out of nearby buildings . new york mayor bill de blasio ( d ) said sunday that the explosion was “ intentional , ” but noted that few details were available because the investigation was in its early stages . “ we know there was a bombing , ” de blasio said . “ we know it was a very serious incident , but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this . ” ad ad he also echoed his comments from saturday night that there was no specific , credible threat against new york from any terrorist group . the fbi and nypd are trying to understand what motivation lay behind the blast . “ we will look at individuals . we will look at associations . we will look at social media , ” william sweeney , assistant director in charge of the fbi new york field office , said . “ until we have that information it is not fair for us to give a conclusion ( as to motivation ) , ” deblasio said . “ let the law enforcement experts draw the conclusions . ” police commissioner james o ’ neill , whose first day in the position was saturday , told reporters on sunday that police were still gathering evidence . ad “ we did find some components indicative of an ied … that went off intentionally , ” o ’ neill said . late saturday , police had ruled out natural gas as a possible cause of the blast . ad the new york police department ’ s counterterrorism bureau responded to the explosion , along with officials with the fbi and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives . while o ’ neill said authorities were still trying to determine what , precisely , exploded , the nypd counterterrorism bureau posted a photo online earlier saturday showing what appeared to be a dumpster or garbage container mangled by a blast : police in new york also reported shortly after 11 p . m . that they had found the “ possible secondary device ” a few blocks away from the chelsea explosion scene , on 27th street between sixth and seventh avenues . police directed people away from that intersection , and one officer could be heard telling pedestrians that “ there is a possible explosive ” in the area . ad not long after midnight , police said in a statement that they were asking people in the area of this potential explosive to move away from their windows “ until we clear the suspicious package , ” although officers did not fully evacuate the area . ad according to the associated press , the second device was removed with a robot and taken to the department firing range in the bronx . o ’ neill said sunday that two “ very dedicated ” former new york state troopers had responded to the initial report of the blast last night . in a search for other explosives , they had parked their vehicle on 27th street . walking down the block , they found the second , unexploded device , o ’ neill said . ad reports of another suspicious package at 28th street and fifth avenue turned out to be a false alarm — the package was only garbage , j . peter donald , a police spokesman , posted on twitter around 12 : 30 a . m . sunday . the chelsea explosion occurred about 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a jersey shore garbage can , shortly before a scheduled charity 5k race there benefiting marines and navy sailors . ad authorities have said they have not yet found anything connecting the chelsea and new jersey incidents but are continuing to investigate . on sunday , cuomo said the “ bombs ” in chelsea “ appear to be different ” from those discovered earlier in the day in new jersey , though the devices from both states were being shipped to the fbi lab in quantico for further assessment . he said the devices in new jersey were “ pipe bombs , ” and those in chelsea were not . cuomo said agents in new york were in touch with those in new jersey . ad cuomo said officials “ have no reason to believe at this time that there is any further immediate threat , ” though the national guard and the new york state police were deploying an additional 1 , 000 personnel to bus terminals , airports and subways “ just to err on the side of caution . ” ad cuomo said the blast in chelsea “ caused significant property damage , ” though he a nearby subway station was structurally safe . he said law enforcement would work diligently to identify and locate those responsible . “ whoever placed these bombs , we will find , and they will be brought to justice , ” cuomo said . the explosion in the area of 23rd street between sixth and seventh avenues occurred about 8 : 30 p . m . police said . several of those injured were brought to area hospitals , donald , the police spokesman , posted on twitter . ad all victims were treated and released by sunday morning , cuomo said . a spokeswoman for lenox health greenwich village , which treated nine of the victims , said patients were treated for minor injuries that included lacerations to the head and body . other hospitals declined to provide specifics about the extent of patients ’ injuries from the explosion . ad photos and accounts posted on social media saturday night showed large crowds — as well as a large law enforcement presence — in the area near where the explosion occurred . soleil filomena , 64 , was leaving a convenience store at seventh avenue and 23rd street when she heard the explosion . “ it was so loud it just went through my whole body , ” she said . “ people started running up 23rd street , and i started running with them . ” ad filomena said she saw a “ big black cloud in the sky . ” after the explosion , she said her “ ear was ringing for 15 minutes . ” when keith salomon of delaware felt the explosion , he was having dinner a block and a half from the site of the blast . his chair and table shook , he said , and he saw people being taken away in ambulances . “ we didn ’ t know what it was and so , at first , we just kept eating , ” said salomon , 52 , who was visiting his son in the city . “ but then we realized something was wrong . ” others did not hear the explosion but saw the aftermath . when jacob schulman left his apartment a few blocks away shortly before 9 p . m . , he saw people running and screaming . ad “ i didn ’ t know what was going on , but everyone looked so panicked . i started running . too , ” said schulman , 26 , who has lived in the neighborhood since 2014 . two blocks from the blast scene , a group of people emerged from a screening of the animated movie “ beauty and the beast ” and saw the flashing lights . one man who came out of the theater said he could not hear anything and had no idea about the explosion not far from where he was sitting . president obama was briefed on the situation in new york and will be updated as more information becomes available , a white house official said late saturday . speaking in colorado not long after the explosion , republican presidential nominee donald trump quickly commented on the situation before much information was known . “ i must tell you that just before i got off the plane , a bomb went off in new york and nobody knows exactly what ’ s going on , ” said trump shortly after getting off of his plane . his comments were made before authorities confirmed the nature of the explosion . late saturday , democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton said it was important to “ know the facts ” before drawing conclusions about such incidents . early sunday , posts on social media from people in new york showed the area of the explosion to be relatively calm and quiet . authorities had closed large swaths of roads in the area saturday night . on sunday , several roads had reopened but there remained a large police presence in the area . the explosion in new york comes as foreign leaders , including many heads of state , are heading to manhattan for the united nations general assembly . secretary of state john f . kerry arrived saturday , while obama is scheduled to head to the city on monday . this annual meeting — held more than two miles from the site of the explosion in chelsea — is traditionally a challenging time for new york , as many roads are shut down and the heavy security leads to traffic jams . the fbi still has no determination as to motive , said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing . agents are examining the detonated material from the first device as well as studying the second , which appeared to resemble a pressure cooker . they are also looking at video from security cameras , social media — “ all the logical leads , ” the official said . the explosion in chelsea coincided with a separate attack that took place in minnesota saturday night , in which a man stabbed eight people in a st . cloud mall before he was killed by an off - duty police officer . on sunday , an isis - linked news agency claimed the mall attacker was “ a soldier of the islamic state . ” an fbi spokesman said in an emailed statement that the agency had not determined whether the stabbings were related to the bombing in manhattan the same night . speaking to cnn ’ s jake tapper on sunday morning , new jersey gov . chris christie ( r )
