wikievents_trigger : report says cia attacks led to civilian deaths and casualties and says us protocols are ' hurdle to transparency ' a united nations investigation has so far identified 33 drone strikes around the world that have resulted in civilian casualties and may have violated international humanitarian law . the report by the un ' s special rapporteur on human rights and counter - terrorism , ben emmerson qc , calls on the us to declassify information about operations co - ordinated by the cia and clarify its positon on the legality of unmanned aerial attacks . published ahead of a debate on the use of remotely piloted aircraft , at the un general assembly in new york next friday , the 22 - page document examines incidents in afghanistan , yemen , iraq , libya , somalia , pakistan and gaza . it has been published to coincide with a related report released earlier on thursday by professor christof heyns , the un ' s special rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , which warned that the technology was being misused as a form of " global policing " . emmerson , who travelled to islamabad for his investigation , said the pakistan ministry of foreign affairs has records of as many as 330 drone strikes in the country ' s north - western tribal areas since 2004 . up to 2 , 200 people have been killed – of whom at least 400 were civilians – according to the pakistan government . in yemen , emmerson ' s report says that as many as 58 civilians are thought to have been killed in attacks by uavs ( unmanned aerial vehicles ) . " while the fact that civilians have been killed or injured does not necessarily point to a violation of international humanitarian law , it undoubtedly raises issues of accountability and transparency , " the study notes . reaper uavs , used by the raf in afghanistan , have a range of 3 , 700 miles ( 5 , 900 km ) , a maximum airspeed of 250 knots and can ascend to 15 , 300 metres ( 50 , 000 feet ) , the document explains . their missions can last up to 18 hours . the reaper carries three cameras as well as laser - guided bombs . three communication networks relay information between the raf ground station in the uk and the uav : " a secure internet - based chat function , a secure radio routed via satellite and a secure telephone system " .

" whoever put that thing together really intended to do a lot of damage , " said mr . roy .

national conﬂict in washington , said that as a test of how easy it was to obtain such guides to destruction , he recently wrote to a publishing house using a child ' s lined notepad and a crayon . three of the bomb - making manuals were promptly [ delivered | trigger for transportation event ] to the address mr . livingstone had given , he said , no questions asked . though [ building | trigger for artifact assembled event ] the bomb was relatively easy , the experts say , it was not by any means free of danger . the bulkiest part of the bomb , they say , was extremely stable and could only have been touched off with a tremendous kick , like that provided by nitroglycerine . making the nitroglycerine , by blending some of the chemicals , was the trickiest part of the process . as the chemicals are mixed to form this compound , said dr . per - anders persson , the director of the center for explosives research at the new mexico institute of mining and technology , they get hot and may explode . often , he said , beakers are packed in dry ice to keep the chemicals at a safe temperature . a dangerous mix the nitroglycerine could have also exploded prematurely with any jolt or sharp change in temperature , the experts said . the bombers risked blowing themselves up as well , the experts said , when they hooked up the wires [ connecting | trigger for artifact assembled event ] the bomb ' s trigger with the blasting cap . dr . robert h . kupperman , a senior adviser for science and technology at the center for strategic and international studies at georgetown university , said that perhaps the greatest [ skill | trigger for attack event ] in making the bomb came in rigging the chain of triggering explosives so they all tore into the bulk of the bomb for maximum effect , as investigators at the world trade center say apparently happened . so far , in more than a week of searching , they have not found a single grain of the main explosive material . sulfuric acid widely sold william lazor , a senior technical consultant at the du pont company in wilmington , del . , said that sulfuric acid is the most widely sold chemical in the united states , used in the [ manufacture | trigger for artifact assembled event ] of everything from battery acid to detergents and shampoos . dale ladysh , another consultant at du pont , said that nitric acid is only slightly behind in popularity . it is used , he said , in the electronics industry and for making stainless steel and many industrial dies and pigmentations . both acids are commonly used metal cleaners . according to rick amberg of amberg perennial farm and garden center in westﬁeld , n . j . , urea is often scattered over lawns to [ make | trigger for artifact assembled event ] them grow lustrously , and is also used in making plastics . mr . amberg [ sells | trigger for transaction event ] a plastic 50 - pound bag of urea for $ 20 . 99 . in newark , the dooner & smith chemical company [ sells | trigger for transaction event ] a 15 - gallon drum of sulfuric acid , weighing 172 pounds , for $ 41 . 28 . the same size container of nitric acid costs $ 44 and weighs 220 pounds . " whoever put that thing together really intended to do a lot of [ damage | trigger for artifact destroyed event ] , " said mr . roy . " this kind of explosive device is often used to fracture and [ move | trigger for transportation event ] rock . it expands slowly with great force . "

wikievents_trigger : thai authorities indict 2 over august shrine attack a bangkok military court has indicted two men accused of carrying out the august 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people . the court on tuesday indicted bilal mohammed and mieraili yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of erawan shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only bilal and mieraili have been detained . they are described as ethnic uighurs , a minority group based in china ' s xinjiang region . they have been held in custody since their arrests in late august and early september . thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . the august 17 blast at the erawan shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . of the dead , 14 were tourists . the attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others . the two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb . members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer chuchart kanpai . doubts about motive early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of uighur separatists who were angry that thailand in july forcibly repatriated more than 100 uighurs to china , where it is feared they face persecution . the theory was bolstered by the fact that the erawan shrine is popular among chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . but thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . the two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last may , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government . former national police chief somyot poomphanmuang said before his retirement in september that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage , witnesses , dna matching and physical evidence , in addition to their confessions . security camera footage from the erawan shrine showed a man wearing a yellow t - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine , took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away . time stamps on closed circuit tv footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred , during evening rush hour as the area in central bangkok was filled with people . police believe that bilal is the yellow - shirted man who planted the bomb and yusufu is believed to have detonated the bomb . bilal , was initially identified as adem karadag , which was the name on a fake turkish passport in his possession when he was arrested aug . 29 . he was arrested at one of two apartments police raided on the outskirts of bangkok . yusufu was arrested sept . 1 near the thai - cambodia border , carrying a chinese passport indicating he was from xinjiang . police said his dna and fingerprints were found in both raided apartments , including on a container of gunpowder . police said they have confessions from the two , and bilal ' s lawyer says his client admitted planting the deadly bomb at the behest of another suspect who remains a fugitive . he says bilal was induced to carry out the action by a promise that his emigration to turkey would be expedited . some material for this report came from ap .

wikievents_trigger : analysis backs claim drones were used to attack venezuela ’ s president analysis of open source information carried out by the investigative website bellingcat suggests drones that had been repurposed as flying bombs were indeed used in an attack on the president of venezuela this weekend . the venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate president nicolás maduro using two drones loaded with explosives . the president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred . initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of maduro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . but the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . ap also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of maduro ’ s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . the venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were dji matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of c4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . dji matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work — with a u . s . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a dji matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors . it also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model , although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed . venezuela ’ s interior minister , nestor reverol , also claimed the government thwarted the attack using " special techniques and ( radio ) signal inhibitors " , which " disoriented " the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand — a capability bellingcat notes the venezuelan security services are reported to have . the second drone was said by reverol to have " lost control " and crashed into a nearby building . bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion . it adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed . " it is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated , creating the hole in the wall of this apartment , igniting a fire , and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in video 2 ( of the state tv broadcast of maduro ’ s speech ) , " it further suggests . here ’ s its conclusion : from the open sources of information available , it appears that an attack took place using two dbieds while maduro was giving a speech . both the drones appear visually similar to dji matrice 600s , with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model . these drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade . the first drone detonated somewhere above or near the parade , the most likely cause of the casualties announced by the venezuelan government and pictured on social media . the second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage , and is the most likely cause of the fire which the venezuelan firefighters described . it also considers the claim of attribution by a group on social media , calling itself " soldados de franelas " ( aka ‘ t - shirt soldiers ’ — a reference to a technique used by protestors wrapping a t - shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity ) , suggesting it ’ s not clear from the group ’ s twitter messages that they are " unequivocally claiming responsibility for the event " , owing to use of passive language , and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government snipers — which it says " does not appear to be supported by the open source information available " .

wikievents_trigger : a wave of attacks across iraq on monday killed 107 people in the country ' s deadliest day in more than two years after al - qaida warned it would mount new attacks and sought to retake territory . officials said at least 214 people were wounded in 27 different attacks launched in 18 cities , shattering a relative calm which had held in the lead - up to the start on saturday of the holy muslim fasting month of ramadan . in monday ' s deadliest attack -- a string of roadside bombs and a car bomb followed by a suicide attack targeting emergency responders in the town of taji -- at least 42 people were killed and 40 wounded , according to two medical officials .

" abu mohammed said he witnessed the deaths of an elderly woman carrying a newborn baby and of the policeman who had first concluded the car was packed with explosives . an agence france presse reporter at the scene said a row of houses were completely destroyed , and residents were rummaging through the rubble in search of victims and their belongings . in baghdad , meanwhile , a car bomb outside a government office responsible for producing identity papers in the shiite bastion of sadr city killed at least 12 people and wounded 22 others , security and medical officials said . " this attack is a terrible crime against humanity , because they did it during ramadan , while people are fasting , " said one elderly witness who declined to be identified . an afp journalist said eight nearby cars were badly burned and many of the victims of the 9 : 30 am ( 0630 gmt ) attack could not be identified because their papers were inside the offices that were targeted . two other explosions in the baghdad neighborhoods of husseiniyah and yarmouk killed at least four people and left 24 others wounded , while a car bomb in the town of tarmiyah , just north of baghdad , hurt nine people , officials said . checkpoint shootings and bomb blasts in restive ethnically - mixed diyala province killed 11 people and left 40 others wounded , security officials and doctor ahmed ibrahim from the main hospital in provincial capital baquba said . insurgents also launched attacks on a military base near the town of dhuluiyah , killing at least 15 iraqi soldiers and leaving two others wounded , according to two security officials . two other attacks in the same province -- a shooting at a checkpoint and a car bomb near a shiite mosque -- left three people dead and six wounded , officials said . nine bomb blasts , some of them minutes apart , meanwhile killed seven people and wounded 29 in kirkuk city and the eponymous province ' s towns of dibis and tuz khurmatu . three different attacks -- a car bomb , a roadside blast and a shooting -- in the main northern city of mosul and the nearby town of baaj left nine people dead and seven wounded , according to iraqi army first lieutenant waad mohammed and police lieutenant mohammed al - juburi . a roadside bomb at a market in the center of the town of diwaniyah , south of baghdad , killed three people and left 25 hurt , provincial health chief adnan turki said . in the western town of heet , a car bomb exploded near an army patrol , killing one soldier and wounding 10 others , according to an iraqi army captain and doctor abdulwahab al - shammari from the town hospital . the attacks came a day after a spate of bombings across iraq killed at least 17 people and wounded nearly 100 others . monday ' s toll was the highest since may 10 , 2010 , when 110 people were killed . the latest violence comes after the country suffered a spike in unrest in june when at least 282 people were killed , according to an afp tally based on figures supplied by officials and medics , although government figures said 131 iraqis died . although those figures are markedly lower than during the peak of iraq ' s communal bloodshed from 2006 to 2008 , attacks remain common . there was no immediate claim of responsibility for monday ' s attacks , but al - qaida ' s front group in iraq has warned in recent days that it seeks to retake territory in the country . the islamic state of iraq warned in an audio message posted on various jihadist forums that it would begin targeting judges and prosecutors , and appealed for the help of sunni tribes in its quest to recapture territory it once held . " we are starting a new stage , " said the voice on the message , purportedly that of abu bakr al - baghdadi , who has been leader of the islamic state of iraq since may 2010 . " the first priority in this is releasing muslim prisoners everywhere , and chasing and eliminating judges and investigators and their guards .

[ ” mcdade | template entity | attacker for attack event = bomb ] , a lieutenant in the birmingham brigade of the ira , blew himself up while trying to plant [ a bomb | template entity | explosive device for attack event = bomb ] [ at coventry telephone exchange | template entity | target for attack event = bomb ] a week before [ the pub | template entity | target for attack event = bombings ] bombings . neither the mulberry bush nor the tavern in the town had any military connection . normal ira procedure at the time for any attack on non - military targets was to give a 30 - minute warning in order for full evacuations to take place . read our docudrama minute - by - minute recreation of the events of november 21 1974 [ the birmingham mail | template entity | participant for communication event = call ] received an ambiguous call at 8 . 11pm on november 21 . the caller did not identify either pub , referring instead to the rotunda , above the mulberry bush and the new street tax office , which was above the underground tavern in the town . the [ first bomb | template entity | explosive device for attack event = bombings ] destroyed [ the mulberry bush | template entity | target for attack event = bombings ] just six minutes later . the tavern was destroyed at 8 . 27pm . conway was not directly involved in the debrief with the england operational commander . [ but he | template entity | participant for communication event = caller ] said he was later told “ that the early indications were that the casualties were the result of yet another failure in the warning system , a succession of phone boxes from which the warning might have been relayed having proved to be inoperable . ” in an interview with a national newspaper he described [ the birmingham | template entity | place for attack event = bombing ] pub bombings as “ a total disaster . ” he added that the secret ‘ feakle talks ’ , held a couple of weeks after the bombings , were used by the ira to try to start to repair its image after [ the birmingham | template entity | place for attack event = bomber ] and [ the guildford | template entity | place for attack event = bomber ] pub bombings . the talks , in feakle , county clare , involved senior ira officials and protestant clergymen and ended abruptly after a tip - off that irish special branch officers were on their way to arrest the republicans . but they set in train a process that eventually led to a brief ceasefire that began on december 22 , 1974 . conway had been recruited in 1970 , having been radicalised during the 1968 student protest movements . he met with senior republicans , including future deputy first minister of northern ireland martin mcguinness and sinn fein president gerry adams . adams continues to deny that he was ever in the ira . conway was later jailed in belfast ’ s notorious crumlin road prison and went on hunger strike to achieve political status . although he left the ira in 1975 , he rejoined during the 1981 hunger strike , then finally broke with the republican movement for good in 1993 when the british and irish governments announced the downing street declaration . he claimed the declaration basically reinforced partition . “ the ira went on ceasefire , it decommissioned and did all the things they said they would never do , and disappeared into history , [ ” he | template entity | participant for communication event = basically ] said . “ it was a complete and utter defeat , absolutely . ” in his book he also claims that rogue irish police officers colluded with the ira throughout the troubles and that members of the dublin establishment , including several mainstream politicians , aided the provisionals in their armed campaign . * southside provisional : from freedom fighter to the four courts is published by orpen press .
