san salvador , 12 nov 89 ( domestic service ) -- ( speech ) ( president alfredo cristiani ) ( text ) good afternoon , salvadoran people. on 19 march , our government was elected by the salvadoran people , who demanded political stability , peaceful coexistence , as well as judicial and social security in our country. these irrational actions that the fmln ( farabundo marti national liberation front ) has unleashed in the last few days , and particularly as of yesterday , make it necessary for the government of the republic to take action , to take firm action within the legal framework of our country. we must accept the people 's mandate of 19 march , and the government must now respond with firm action , within the legal framework. we must respond because the fmln is attacking the civilian population -- more than anyone else -- in a brutal and savage manner. the armed forces of el salvador are controlling the situation , and they have controlled the situation. however , these fmln terrorists , who already feel they have been defeated by the armed forces , are now beginning to carry out indiscriminate acts of terrorism. they are even going as far as entering innocent homes to pressure families who are trying to live through these harsh times that all salvadorans have experienced. that is why we must act firmly but within the law. to this effect , salvadoran people , the council of ministers met at 1400 in the presidential house to try to solve something we are completely sure is what the salvadoran people want. when we sat down to talk with the members of the cabinet , we recalled article 2 of our constitution , which says : all persons have a right to life , physical and moral integrity , freedom , security , work , property , and the right to be protected and have their lives and possessions defended. that is why the council of ministers this afternoon made a decision , based on the legal mechanisms granted to it by the constitution. first , salvadoran people , i will read article 29 of the constitution , which reads as follows : article 29. in cases of war , invasion of the territory , rebellion , sedition , catastrophe , epidemic , or other general calamity , or in cases of grave disruption of the public order , the guarantees estalished in articles 5 , article 6 , subparagraph 1 , article 7 , subparagraph 1 , and article 24 can be suspended , except when referring to meetings or groups for religious , cultural , economic , and sports purposes. the suspension can affect the entire country or part of it and will be done through a decree issued by the legislative branch or the executive branch , as appropriate. the guarantees contained in article 12 , subparagraph 2 , and in article 13 , subparagraph 2 , of the constitution can be suspended , when the legislative branch so decides by a three-fourths majority vote of the elected deputies , but the administrative suspension detencion administrativa should not be longer than 15 days. the suspension of the constitutional guarantees will not exceed 30 days. once this period expires , the suspension can be extended for a similar period of time , through a new decree , if the circumstances that led to it continue. if that decree is not issued , the suspended guarantees will be fully restored. as you will see , this article states that it is the legislative branch or the executive branch , as appropriate ...

clandestine , 8 jan 90 ( radio venceremos ) -- ( station commentary ) ( text ) goodbye ( air force commander ) general rafael bustillo , false hope for mass killers. gen. bustillo resigns or is made to resign as the air force chief. because of this , the general is admitting that without the bombing on san salvador 's neighborhoods the fmln ( farabundo marti national liberation front ) would have defeated the salvadoran armed forces. bustillo 's resignation is yet another sign of the failure of 10 years of the u.s. counterinsurgency policy in el salvador , as became clear with the offensive launched on 10 november. for 10 years the military and their u.s. sponsors based their trust in the air power to drown in blood the aspiration of the nation to achieve democracy and social justice. this first happened in the interior of the country , with the destruction of dozens of towns like tenancingo , berlin , torola , san fernando , and so many others that took place along with the genocide carried out by the infantry with the mass murders of civilians in el mosoto , sunpul , and ocotapayo. bustillo is leaving as so many generals and u.s. ambassadors have. and like all of them his departure reveals the imperialist power 's failure to consolidate its counterinsurgency program in el salvador. as all the others who have left , bustillo also seeks excuses in the face of his failure , by accusing others. he accuses ( former defense minister eugenio ) vides casanova of being soft in fighting the people 's plan. one would have to ask bustillo if the air force , of which he represented its most encouraging pillar , was soft when it murdered 70,000 salvadorans , monsignor arnulfo romero and the jesuit priests included , and even when it murdered patriot officers of that same army. was the u.s. pentagon soft when it gave $ 3 billion , weapons , and bombs for the most cowardly act of genocide latin america can recall this century ? the u.s. strategy , implemented through the top military command in the past 10 years with all its might did all it could so that the permanent rebellion in the rural areas reached the country 's vital centers , as indeed happened as of the 10 november offensive. bustillo states it clearly. the bombing temporarily halted the defeat of the top command. through an act of genocide , it managed to remove the disgruntled people from the neighborhoods where the guerrilla forces were. bustillo acknowledges genocide is the sole way the armed forces can survive. bustillo acknowledges the fmln 's strength and therefore urges the armed forces to be tougher and inflexible and rejects a political solution to the conflict. a political solution would express the consensus among the country 's major sectors. obviously the top command represents a decadent minority. bustillo supports launching a fascist crusade against the people 's wish for democracy. in this effort , he lashes out at the catholic church , all opposition sectors that report human rights violations , and all sectors that support democratizing the country. in conclusion , we say that bustillo is not resigning of his own volition. the fmln action eliminated bustillo as it eliminated garcia , vides , and so many other military chiefs who left their posts without fulfilling the task commissioned by the united states : to stop the fmln. the fmln offensive bared the genocidal , antipopular , and fascist nature of the alfredo cristiani regime to such an extent that it prompted a strong debate in the united states on cutting military aid. the jesuits ' murders and the bombings so shook the international community that it is pressuring for punishment of the officers involved in these incidents. however , the bush administration accepted this , since colonel rene emilio ponce ( chairman of the joints chiefs of staff ) and his clique , even cristiani , must shoulder this responsibility. we must not forget that in costa rica the salvadoran defense minister disclosed cristiani authorized the bombings. bush needed a scapegoat to place it on the altar of the debates which will begin in the u.s. congress on the fate of military aid. bustillo is bush 's scapegoat. however , bustillo was already a useless element of the murderous machinery that remains active. will the u.s. public and congress be appeased with this foul tasting candy ? time and the spirit of the times are obviously running against the fascist program in el salvador. while peoples of the world tear down dogmas , dictatorships , and walls , bustillo , who leaves through the door of defeat , asks the armed forces to be tougher , commit more genocide , and build more walls of repression against the church , the people , and the nation as a whole. goodbye , gen. bustillo. we continue writing history without you. the decade we begin is of democracy , independence , and self-determination. that is why foreign intervention and the walls of intolerance have a short life span in this country , where the people grow in heroism and the struggle for social change is not deterred by bombings .

santiago , 9 jan 90 -- ( commentary ) ( olga klivadenko ) ( text ) the deployment of u.s. ships , including the aircraft carrier " john f. kennedy " and the corvette " virginia " along the colombian coast yesterday , seeking to intercept drug trafficking routes , could be the result of three policies : first , that the united states needs to justify the invasion of panama under the excuse of its fight against drug trafficking. second , that both the deployment of ships and the invasion of panama are part of a serious military plan to end the drug plague. third , that the united states must somehow justify the invasion of panama and the need to recover its international image has provided a real opportunity to put an end to drug trafficking. if the objective really is to eliminate drugs , then the battle is praiseworthy , but -- like in panama -- the procedure is painful , overbearing , imperialistic , and humiliating. instead of winning the latin american countries ' appreciation and solidarity with this laudable cause , the united states is again provoking angry reactions and deep distrust. the side effects of this action could be very negative for the struggle against drug trafficking , in which all the countries of this continent should be cooperating. alternatively , would it be better if they did not cooperate in this phase ? could it be that what we have called imperialistic clumsiness , insensibility , and abuse , is simply a deliberate strategy with which , perhaps for well founded reasons and even at the risk of diplomatic conflicts , the united states seeks to isolate latin america on purpose and thus ensure the success of its operation ? if this were the case then we must ask , why ? from its operations in panama and colombia , the united states is telling us that it is not concerned with the diplomatic aspect for the time being. the united states wants action and efficiency. the united states is losing its patience , and perhaps its confidence in the seriousness and capability of latin america to face this war. if the action in colombia goes further than a mere surveillance , the united states will be establishing a precedent in this battle against drug trafficking. this means that during a first phase the united states will carry out a military operation by itself. during a second phase it will discuss secondary subjects but with less urgency in the war against drug trafficking. next 15 february , bush will meet in cartagena de indias , colombia , with his colombian , peruvian , and bolivian counterparts. perhaps on that occasion they will talk about the other aspects of this war : the reorganization of the local economies to end the dependency on coca plantations , the recovery of drug addicts , and the consolidation of governments , etc. during this current phase , however , the united states wishes to act alone. who knows if it is because of latin america 's lack of understanding ? as we said a few days ago , the drug trafficking problem is creating new situations in international relations. the u.s. proposal is probably something like : could a world power like the united states continue to ignore a serious problem like the production , distribution , and consumption of drugs , merely to avoid harming latin american sensibilities , sensibilities of countries whose governments are always muddled up in useless diplomatic and bureaucratic procedures and fruitless negotiations ? and all this while a large part of the developed world 's population is becoming addicted to a deadly product ? the united states could also be asking itself : have the latin american governments been able to solve this serious problem by themselves ? can those governments stop drug trafficking when it is known that drugs and corruption go hand in hand ; when in the past and perhaps in the present , high ranking government officials have been linked with this illegal trade and protecting the medellin cartel chiefs ? why , for example , after all this has n't the colombian government managed to extradite the main chiefs of that cartel to the united states ? let us recall the horrible explosion of the colombian airliner , in which more than 100 people died ; the bomb explosion in the secret police headquarters in bogota ; the murder of many journalists who were engaged in an heroic war against drug trafficking ; and mainly , let us recall the ever-present difficulties that must be faced when the medellin cartel chiefs must be punished and extradited .

san salvador , 19 mar 89 ( radio cadena sonora ) -- ( communique ) ( farabundo marti national liberation front general command ) ( text ) esteemed members of the government commission : today , 9 march , we have received a message signed by the members of your commission asking us to begin the peace talks. we have already addressed this issue on numerous occasions , expressing our willingness to hold a meeting. the government commission 's letter makes no mention of any move to postpone the elections. it does not even consider including this topic on the meeting 's agenda. on the contrary , it is clear that the commission has already decided to hold the elections on 19 march. consequently , the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) hereby informs the government commission and the salvadoran people of the following : 1. the government commission must clearly and publicly announce that it is willing to reach an agreement on confining the army to its barracks on the day of the elections , establishing an electoral code by consensus , providing absentee voting for salvadorans living abroad , restructuring the central elections council , and forming a council for verification. more importantly , it must express the state powers ' willingness to postpone the elections for 5 months , once a cease-fire has been agreed upon. we also believe that the government commission must publicly announce that it is willing to bring military commanders and officers responsible for political murders and crimes to trial , to reduce the salvadoran armed forces to the number of troops it had in 1968 , and to disband the security forces to form a new civil police. we reiterate our willingness to discuss permanently ceasing the armed struggle. 2. if the government commission agrees to the above requests , the fmln will agree to a meeting and is willing to immediately decide on a date and a time for the meeting. the fmln is even willing to hold the meeting outside el salvador. as a part of this meeting , we are willing to negotiate and come to an agreement with the armed forces staff on a cease-fire that will bring about a permanent and negotiated solution to the conflict. 3. if no such agreement is reached , then there is no point in holding the meeting prior to 19 march , because it will simply be used by both the christian democratic party ( pdc ) and the nationalist republican alliance ( arena ) in their election dispute. the elections play no role in achieving peace ; they only serve to provide a false justification for continuing the war. 4. we await a response from the government commission. el salvador , 9 march 1989 fmln general command ( signed ) commander salvador sanchez ceren commander francisco jovel commander jorge shafik handal commander eduardo sancho commander joaquin villalobos

san salvador , 19 mar 89 ( radio cadena sonora ) -- ( communique ) ( farabundo marti national liberation front general command ) ( text ) esteemed members of the government commission : today , 9 march , we have received a message signed by the members of your commission asking us to begin the peace talks. we have already addressed this issue on numerous occasions , expressing our willingness to hold a meeting. the government commission 's letter makes no mention of any move to postpone the elections. it does not even consider including this topic on the meeting 's agenda. on the contrary , it is clear that the commission has already decided to hold the elections on 19 march. consequently , the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) hereby informs the government commission and the salvadoran people of the following : 1. the government commission must clearly and publicly announce that it is willing to reach an agreement on confining the army to its barracks on the day of the elections , establishing an electoral code by consensus , providing absentee voting for salvadorans living abroad , restructuring the central elections council , and forming a council for verification. more importantly , it must express the state powers ' willingness to postpone the elections for 5 months , once a cease-fire has been agreed upon. we also believe that the government commission must publicly announce that it is willing to bring military commanders and officers responsible for political murders and crimes to trial , to reduce the salvadoran armed forces to the number of troops it had in 1968 , and to disband the security forces to form a new civil police. we reiterate our willingness to discuss permanently ceasing the armed struggle. 2. if the government commission agrees to the above requests , the fmln will agree to a meeting and is willing to immediately decide on a date and a time for the meeting. the fmln is even willing to hold the meeting outside el salvador. as a part of this meeting , we are willing to negotiate and come to an agreement with the armed forces staff on a cease-fire that will bring about a permanent and negotiated solution to the conflict. 3. if no such agreement is reached , then there is no point in holding the meeting prior to 19 march , because it will simply be used by both the christian democratic party ( pdc ) and the nationalist republican alliance ( arena ) in their election dispute. the elections play no role in achieving peace ; they only serve to provide a false justification for continuing the war. 4. we await a response from the government commission. el salvador , 9 march 1989 fmln general command ( signed ) commander salvador sanchez ceren commander francisco jovel commander jorge shafik handal commander eduardo sancho commander joaquin villalobos
