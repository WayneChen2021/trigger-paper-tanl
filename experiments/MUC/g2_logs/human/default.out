mucevent_argument : clandestine , 8 jan 90 ( radio venceremos ) -- ( station commentary ) ( text ) goodbye ( air force commander ) general rafael bustillo , false hope for mass killers. gen. bustillo resigns or is made to resign as the air force chief. because of this , the general is admitting that without the bombing on san salvador 's neighborhoods the fmln ( farabundo marti national liberation front ) would have defeated the salvadoran armed forces. bustillo 's resignation is yet another sign of the failure of 10 years of the u.s. counterinsurgency policy in el salvador , as became clear with the offensive launched on 10 november. for 10 years the military and their u.s. sponsors based their trust in the air power to drown in blood the aspiration of the nation to achieve democracy and social justice. this first happened in the interior of the country , with the destruction of dozens of towns like tenancingo , berlin , torola , san fernando , and so many others that took place along with the genocide carried out by the infantry with the mass murders of civilians in el mosoto , sunpul , and ocotapayo. bustillo is leaving as so many generals and u.s. ambassadors have. and like all of them his departure reveals the imperialist power 's failure to consolidate its counterinsurgency program in el salvador. as all the others who have left , bustillo also seeks excuses in the face of his failure , by accusing others. he accuses ( former defense minister eugenio ) vides casanova of being soft in fighting the people 's plan. one would have to ask bustillo if the air force , of which he represented its most encouraging pillar , was soft when it [ murdered | trigger for attack event ] 70,000 salvadorans , monsignor arnulfo romero and the jesuit priests included , and even when it murdered patriot officers of that same army. was the u.s. pentagon soft when it gave $ 3 billion , weapons , and bombs for the most cowardly act of genocide latin america can recall this century ? the u.s. strategy , implemented through the top military command in the past 10 years with all its might did all it could so that the permanent rebellion in the rural areas reached the country 's vital centers , as indeed happened as of the 10 november offensive. bustillo states it clearly. the bombing temporarily halted the defeat of the top command. through an act of genocide , it managed to remove the disgruntled people from the neighborhoods where the guerrilla forces were. bustillo acknowledges genocide is the sole way the armed forces can survive. bustillo acknowledges the fmln 's strength and therefore urges the armed forces to be tougher and inflexible and rejects a political solution to the conflict. a political solution would express the consensus among the country 's major sectors. obviously the top command represents a decadent minority. bustillo supports launching a fascist crusade against the people 's wish for democracy. in this effort , he lashes out at the catholic church , all opposition sectors that report human rights violations , and all sectors that support democratizing the country. in conclusion , we say that bustillo is not resigning of his own volition. the fmln action eliminated bustillo as it eliminated garcia , vides , and so many other military chiefs who left their posts without fulfilling the task commissioned by the united states : to stop the fmln. the fmln offensive bared the genocidal , antipopular , and fascist nature of the alfredo cristiani regime to such an extent that it prompted a strong debate in the united states on cutting military aid. the jesuits ' murders and the bombings so shook the international community that it is pressuring for punishment of the officers involved in these incidents. however , the bush administration accepted this , since colonel rene emilio ponce ( chairman of the joints chiefs of staff ) and his clique , even cristiani , must shoulder this responsibility. we must not forget that in costa rica the salvadoran defense minister disclosed cristiani authorized the bombings. bush needed a scapegoat to place it on the altar of the debates which will begin in the u.s. congress on the fate of military aid. bustillo is bush 's scapegoat. however , bustillo was already a useless element of the murderous machinery that remains active. will the u.s. public and congress be appeased with this foul tasting candy ? time and the spirit of the times are obviously running against the fascist program in el salvador. while peoples of the world tear down dogmas , dictatorships , and walls , bustillo , who leaves through the door of defeat , asks the armed forces to be tougher , commit more genocide , and build more walls of repression against the church , the people , and the nation as a whole. goodbye , gen. bustillo. we continue writing history without you. the decade we begin is of democracy , independence , and self-determination. that is why foreign intervention and the walls of intolerance have a short life span in this country , where the people grow in heroism and the struggle for social change is not deterred by bombings .

mucevent_trigger : la paz , 4 dec 89 ( efe ) -- ( text ) the political negotiations that resulted in jaime paz zamora 's installation as president of the republic will again take place in the next weeks to decide who will be installed as mayor of la paz. the municipal elections held yesterday did not clearly indicate who will be the mayor of the country 's biggest city , where the candidates of the populist new political groups and those of the traditional parties received approximately the same number of votes. according to unofficial returns released by the private television channels , which in previous elections have proven to be very similar to those of the national electoral court , carlos palenque , 45 , a radio and television businessman and the leader of the conscience of the fatherland ( condepa ) , has received most of the votes. palenque received 39.9 percent of the votes cast in la paz , thereby giving condepa 5 of the 13 seats on the town council , which will elect the mayor of la paz on 2 january. the alliance of the right wing nationalist democratic action ( adn ) and the social democratic movement of the revolutionary left ( mir ) has also won five town council seats. ronald maclean , 40 and of scottish ancestry , the mayoral candidate of the adn-mir alliance , has obtained 36.8 percent of the votes in la paz , where he has been the mayor since l985. far behind were the former administration 's party , the nationalist revolutionary movement ( mnr ) , which received two seats , and the populist solidarity civic union ( ucs ) , led by brewery owner max fernandez , with one town council seat. the decision as to who will be the new la paz mayor on 2 january is now in the hands of the mnr , but its leaders declined to comment on their position last night. gonzalo sanchez de losada , the leader of the mnr , last night said on television : " we must be extremely serious in searching for a solution to this problem , or the people will turn their backs on populism. " he said his decision will be " a christmas present. " he insisted , however , that in his opinion the governing adn-mir alliance " will easily fix things between them " because " they are two of a kind. " although the mnr was the party to receive most of the votes in the 7 may presidential elections , it was due to an alliance between two old political enemies -- the adn and mir -- that jaime paz zamora , who had come third in the elections , was installed as president of the republic. " if we applied this same rule to the current problem , " sanchez de losada said jokingly , " guido capra ( mnr candidate for mayor of la paz ) would be elected. " sanchez de losada pointed out that palenque was one of the supporters of the adn-mir governing alliance , which prevented sanchez de losada from becoming president. according to the opposition , palenque 's party gained the la paz development corporation ( cordepaz ) and " half a ministry " ( referring to the communications and transportation ministry ) as a result of the alliance. sanchez de losada warned the bolivian politicians that palenque 's populist group , which is growing very fast , has its eyes set " on the l993 presidential elections , not only on the la paz mayorship. " while respect was shown toward ronald maclean , the candidate most criticized by the mnr during the municipal elections campaign was palenque. palenque stated , however , that the councilmen who on 2 january will elect the next mayor of la paz must " respect the will of the majority. " " we hope that there will be no negotiation ( among parties ) and that the desire of the majority will be respected , " palenque stated. he is well known , especially because of the beard he wears , which makes him look very much like former u.s. president abraham lincoln. palenque , who is certain of the support he will receive from the only ucs councilman in la paz , fears that a pact between the adn-mir coalition and the mnr will prevent him from obtaining the mayorship of the most important city in the country. such an alliance , however , with a greater ideological basis than any other , will have to overcome the grudge that the mnr bears because the adn and the mir " had stolen from it " the presidency of the republic during the last elections , according to commentators. " we are going to be very responsible , and we are not going to be motivated by personal interests or by any vengeance , " sanchez de losada stated , commenting on the negotiations that will take place to designate the mayor of la paz. like in la paz , the government alliance will have to negotiate support in the other major bolivian cities , where the coalition came in first but failed to win absolute majorities. the only exception is sucre , where the candidate of the united left coalition , radio reporter omar montalvo , obtained 57.3 percent of the votes , which is sufficient to obtain the mayorship. the most outstanding points about the elections were the abstention of between 30 and 50 percent of the voters and the almost absolute normalcy during the elections. the state of siege decreed throughout the country on 15 november due to street confrontations caused by social disturbances did not hamper the electoral process. the traditional restrictions , however , affected traffic and hampered public transportation , keeping voters from casting their votes. the abstention was also caused by the weariness of the voters , who are voting for the fourth time in 4 years .

( begin recording ) ( unidentified reporter ) the border closure measure expires today. will it be extended ? ( garcia ) no , the borders were never closed. we only established some restrictions on the use of transit permits in tacna to prevent an increase of smuggling before the year-end festivities. the 15-day term of that measure has expired , and it will not be extended. ( reporter ) apparently , that measure has not had good results. ( garcia ) i think that in general it has yielded positive results because smuggling has probably decreased somewhat. as you know , a few years ago chile established the iquique free zone where products are sold to peru and bolivia. thus a stable market of hundreds of thousands of people which daily pass thorough the tacna border with small packages has been established. we simply restricted the permits they use to bring in a tape recorder or laser disc players. i understand that smuggling decreased for a few days. however , that merchandise entered the country by other means. we can not impose too many restrictions , but we can ask the customs office and the police to increase their efforts to control excessive smuggling into the country. ( reporter ) do you think that the free-market dollar will drop by january ? ( garcia ) i am sure it will. last year , like now , the free- market dollar exchange rate increased sharply because companies are paying year-end bonuses and they are converting their profits into dollars. people are taking holiday trips and buying more goods and home appliances. therefore , the dollar demand and prices have increased. last year , when the muc ( single exchange market ) dollar exchange rate was at 500 intis to a dollar , the free-market dollar climbed to 2,000 intis. later it dropped to 1,000 intis in january. i think that the same thing will happen this year. ( passage omitted ) ( reporter ) there have been some rumors in the past few days that the economy minister is about to resign or is being pressured to resign. is this true ? ( garcia ) the only person who could pressure him is the president of the republic , and i can tell you that i am not pressuring him. we acknowledge the current difficulties of the peruvian economy as well as the efforts of the economy minister. i express my recognition of and support for the economy minister because he is young , well-intentioned , and very honest ; he has progressive ideas. he is making every effort possible to stabilize the economy as well as possible , and he sponsored a democratic transition after the elections. ( reporter ) today did the council of ministers discuss a wage increase for this month ? ( garcia ) that point must be defined by the economy and labor ministers. today , in addition to the border issue , we discussed a subject we had talked about a few weeks ago. on that occasion i listened to a report from the so-called commander huaihuacu. he is chief of some 85 peasant communities along the apurimac river which have rebelled against shining path control. the apurimac river separates the ayacucho and cusco departments , and these peasants live in an area called oreja de perro in la mar province. they have carried out a democratic uprising and organized themselves to keep shining path from entering their communities. this so-called commander huaihuacu , who is a man of action , has organized approximately 85 communities on the banks of the apurimac river , in ayacucho province of la mar and the cusco district of charate. huaihuacu has come to lima seeking support. we have decided with the defense ministry to go tomorrow to rinconada baja area in la mar province , shining path 's primary area of activity for 10 years. there i will dedicate a radio station to be called radio democracia. its aim will be to broadcast news and democratic and patriotic messages from that area which is a center of peasant resistance against terrorism. we will arrive there tomorrow and talk with the peasant leaders who for years have fought shining path together with our navy infantry units stationed in luisiana and san francisco.

" before meeting with the reporters , the uca rector met with officials from scotland yard. a few days ago , he also met spanish , canadian , and u.s. policemen who , at the government 's request , are assisting the salvadoran commission in charge of clarifying this case .

" however , he did not reveal the names or the military ranks of the suspects. the prosecutor said that the scientific test conducted by the commission to investigate criminal actions and the specialized police working on this case have determined that the crime could have been perpetrated by armed forces members. " the attorney general office will proceed according to the law and against whoever turns out to be guilty , because it is the constitutional duty of the attorney general 's office , " colorado said. asked about this issue , justice minister dr oscar alfredo santamaria , president of the commission to investigate criminal actions said : " we understand that the most recent information on this case was announced by the president of the republic a few days ago. " he refused to make any further statements. new uca ( central american university ) rector jesuit francisco estrada admitted president alfredo cristiani has taken " a step forward " by unmasking the suspects in this crime , " because his ethic principles do not tolerate such atrocities. " estrada said he understands why cristiani , during his 7 january speech , did not give any names , " because the investigations are still being conducted. " moreover , there must not only be one suspect , but rather several. " before meeting with the reporters , the uca rector met with officials from scotland yard. a few days ago , he also met spanish , canadian , and u.s. policemen who , at the government 's request , are assisting the salvadoran commission in charge of clarifying this case .
