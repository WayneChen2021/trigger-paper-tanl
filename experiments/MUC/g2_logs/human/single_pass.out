la paz , 4 dec 89 ( efe ) -- ( text ) the political negotiations that resulted in jaime paz zamora 's installation as president of the republic will again take place in the next weeks to decide who will be installed as mayor of la paz. the municipal elections held yesterday did not clearly indicate who will be the mayor of the country 's biggest city , where the candidates of the populist new political groups and those of the traditional parties received approximately the same number of votes. according to unofficial returns released by the private television channels , which in previous elections have proven to be very similar to those of the national electoral court , carlos palenque , 45 , a radio and television businessman and the leader of the conscience of the fatherland ( condepa ) , has received most of the votes. palenque received 39.9 percent of the votes cast in la paz , thereby giving condepa 5 of the 13 seats on the town council , which will elect the mayor of la paz on 2 january. the alliance of the right wing nationalist democratic action ( adn ) and the social democratic movement of the revolutionary left ( mir ) has also won five town council seats. ronald maclean , 40 and of scottish ancestry , the mayoral candidate of the adn-mir alliance , has obtained 36.8 percent of the votes in la paz , where he has been the mayor since l985. far behind were the former administration 's party , the nationalist revolutionary movement ( mnr ) , which received two seats , and the populist solidarity civic union ( ucs ) , led by brewery owner max fernandez , with one town council seat. the decision as to who will be the new la paz mayor on 2 january is now in the hands of the mnr , but its leaders declined to comment on their position last night. gonzalo sanchez de losada , the leader of the mnr , last night said on television : " we must be extremely serious in searching for a solution to this problem , or the people will turn their backs on populism. " he said his decision will be " a christmas present. " he insisted , however , that in his opinion the governing adn-mir alliance " will easily fix things between them " because " they are two of a kind. " although the mnr was the party to receive most of the votes in the 7 may presidential elections , it was due to an alliance between two old political enemies -- the adn and mir -- that jaime paz zamora , who had come third in the elections , was installed as president of the republic. " if we applied this same rule to the current problem , " sanchez de losada said jokingly , " guido capra ( mnr candidate for mayor of la paz ) would be elected. " sanchez de losada pointed out that palenque was one of the supporters of the adn-mir governing alliance , which prevented sanchez de losada from becoming president. according to the opposition , palenque 's party gained the la paz development corporation ( cordepaz ) and " half a ministry " ( referring to the communications and transportation ministry ) as a result of the alliance. sanchez de losada warned the bolivian politicians that palenque 's populist group , which is growing very fast , has its eyes set " on the l993 presidential elections , not only on the la paz mayorship. " while respect was shown toward ronald maclean , the candidate most criticized by the mnr during the municipal elections campaign was palenque. palenque stated , however , that the councilmen who on 2 january will elect the next mayor of la paz must " respect the will of the majority. " " we hope that there will be no negotiation ( among parties ) and that the desire of the majority will be respected , " palenque stated. he is well known , especially because of the beard he wears , which makes him look very much like former u.s. president abraham lincoln. palenque , who is certain of the support he will receive from the only ucs councilman in la paz , fears that a pact between the adn-mir coalition and the mnr will prevent him from obtaining the mayorship of the most important city in the country. such an alliance , however , with a greater ideological basis than any other , will have to overcome the grudge that the mnr bears because the adn and the mir " had stolen from it " the presidency of the republic during the last elections , according to commentators. " we are going to be very responsible , and we are not going to be motivated by personal interests or by any vengeance , " sanchez de losada stated , commenting on the negotiations that will take place to designate the mayor of la paz. like in la paz , the government alliance will have to negotiate support in the other major bolivian cities , where the coalition came in first but failed to win absolute majorities. the only exception is sucre , where the candidate of the united left coalition , radio reporter omar montalvo , obtained 57.3 percent of the votes , which is sufficient to obtain the mayorship. the most outstanding points about the elections were the abstention of between 30 and 50 percent of the voters and the almost absolute normalcy during the elections. the state of siege decreed throughout the country on 15 november due to street confrontations caused by social disturbances did not hamper the electoral process. the traditional restrictions , however , affected traffic and hampered public transportation , keeping voters from casting their votes. the abstention was also caused by the weariness of the voters , who are voting for the fourth time in 4 years .

lima , 28 nov 89 ( efe ) -- ( text ) delegates to a latin american congress that is being held in lima on missing detainees in latin america today expressed their " concern " that the largest number of detainees and missing people are to be found in the countries that have democratic governments. " we believe that there are groups that are responsible for the disappearances. these groups are organized by the state itself to get rid of its political opponents and these groups are equipped with all the resources required to engage in acts of impunity , " said the congress spokesperson. about 200 delegates from 12 latin american countries and from european and u.s. human rights organizations are participating in the ix congress of the latin american federation of associations of relatives of missing detainees that began today and will end on 30 november in lima. sola sierra , a member of the federation , has told efe that " the on the escalation of these practices , and on the impunity prevailing in all countries where this method of repression prevails. " sierra , a chilean citizen , said that this year the countries with the largest number of missing detainees are colombia , el salvador , guatemala , and peru , " where political violence has increased. " however , she failed to mention the number of missing detainees. sierra , the chilean delegate and the president of the chilean association of relatives of missing people , said that there is no total number of missing people , but that more than 100,000 people have been reported missing throughout latin america since 1981. " this figure has increased at a frightening rate , and we regret that the largest numbers of cases have been reported in countries with democratic governments , " she added. she said that " neither under a dictatorship nor under a democracy " has the problem of the missing detainees been resolved because the government " always manage to talk its way out of investigating or punishing. " ( the governments ) argue that it is necessary to forget the past in order to build the present and that it is necessary to reconcile if peace is to prevail. but how can there be peace and reconciliation while extremely serious events like the massive killing of human beings continue , " she added. sierra regretted that " there is very strong press censorship , and , what is worse , a self-imposed censorship ( autocensura ) " in the countries where most missing detainees have been reported. these situations always lead us to believe that it is the state that promotes this entire policy , that is to say , the use of state terrorism in countries where a state of law , courts , and established legal practices prevail , sierra commented. in today 's session , a member of the peruvian delegation said that over the past 10 years at least 4,000 people , mostly peasants and andean community leaders , who were " arrested by government officials who later denied it , " have disappeared. the member of the peruvian delegation said that , according to official figures , about 15,000 people have been killed as a result of political violence in peru , and that a " negligible number " has been killed in clashes .

lima , 7 dec 89 ( television peruana ) -- ( excerpts ) president alan garcia announced that the borders will be reopened. he said that the results of the measures adopted 15 days ago are positive. the president called on all businessmen and industrialists not to speculate on prices. he also reiterated his support for economy and finance minister cesar vasquez bazan , who he said is making great efforts to face the peruvian economic situation. garcia made these statements after a meeting with the council of ministers. ( begin recording ) ( unidentified reporter ) the border closure measure expires today. will it be extended ? ( garcia ) no , the borders were never closed. we only established some restrictions on the use of transit permits in tacna to prevent an increase of smuggling before the year-end festivities. the 15-day term of that measure has expired , and it will not be extended. ( reporter ) apparently , that measure has not had good results. ( garcia ) i think that in general it has yielded positive results because smuggling has probably decreased somewhat. as you know , a few years ago chile established the iquique free zone where products are sold to peru and bolivia. thus a stable market of hundreds of thousands of people which daily pass thorough the tacna border with small packages has been established. we simply restricted the permits they use to bring in a tape recorder or laser disc players. i understand that smuggling decreased for a few days. however , that merchandise entered the country by other means. we can not impose too many restrictions , but we can ask the customs office and the police to increase their efforts to control excessive smuggling into the country. ( reporter ) do you think that the free-market dollar will drop by january ? ( garcia ) i am sure it will. last year , like now , the free- market dollar exchange rate increased sharply because companies are paying year-end bonuses and they are converting their profits into dollars. people are taking holiday trips and buying more goods and home appliances. therefore , the dollar demand and prices have increased. last year , when the muc ( single exchange market ) dollar exchange rate was at 500 intis to a dollar , the free-market dollar climbed to 2,000 intis. later it dropped to 1,000 intis in january. i think that the same thing will happen this year. ( passage omitted ) ( reporter ) there have been some rumors in the past few days that the economy minister is about to resign or is being pressured to resign. is this true ? ( garcia ) the only person who could pressure him is the president of the republic , and i can tell you that i am not pressuring him. we acknowledge the current difficulties of the peruvian economy as well as the efforts of the economy minister. i express my recognition of and support for the economy minister because he is young , well-intentioned , and very honest ; he has progressive ideas. he is making every effort possible to stabilize the economy as well as possible , and he sponsored a democratic transition after the elections. ( reporter ) today did the council of ministers discuss a wage increase for this month ? ( garcia ) that point must be defined by the economy and labor ministers. today , in addition to the border issue , we discussed a subject we had talked about a few weeks ago. on that occasion i listened to a report from the so-called commander huaihuacu. he is chief of some 85 peasant communities along the apurimac river which have rebelled against shining path control. the apurimac river separates the ayacucho and cusco departments , and these peasants live in an area called oreja de perro in la mar province. they have carried out a democratic uprising and organized themselves to keep shining path from entering their communities. this so-called commander huaihuacu , who is a man of action , has organized approximately 85 communities on the banks of the apurimac river , in ayacucho province of la mar and the cusco district of charate. huaihuacu has come to lima seeking support. we have decided with the defense ministry to go tomorrow to rinconada baja area in la mar province , shining path 's primary area of activity for 10 years. there i will dedicate a radio station to be called radio democracia. its aim will be to broadcast news and democratic and patriotic messages from that area which is a center of peasant resistance against terrorism. we will arrive there tomorrow and talk with the peasant leaders who for years have fought shining path together with our navy infantry units stationed in luisiana and san francisco.

san salvador , 19 mar 89 ( radio cadena sonora ) -- ( communique ) ( farabundo marti national liberation front general command ) ( text ) esteemed members of the government commission : today , 9 march , we have received a message signed by the members of your commission asking us to begin the peace talks. we have already addressed this issue on numerous occasions , expressing our willingness to hold a meeting. the government commission 's letter makes no mention of any move to postpone the elections. it does not even consider including this topic on the meeting 's agenda. on the contrary , it is clear that the commission has already decided to hold the elections on 19 march. consequently , the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) hereby informs the government commission and the salvadoran people of the following : 1. the government commission must clearly and publicly announce that it is willing to reach an agreement on confining the army to its barracks on the day of the elections , establishing an electoral code by consensus , providing absentee voting for salvadorans living abroad , restructuring the central elections council , and forming a council for verification. more importantly , it must express the state powers ' willingness to postpone the elections for 5 months , once a cease-fire has been agreed upon. we also believe that the government commission must publicly announce that it is willing to bring military commanders and officers responsible for political murders and crimes to trial , to reduce the salvadoran armed forces to the number of troops it had in 1968 , and to disband the security forces to form a new civil police. we reiterate our willingness to discuss permanently ceasing the armed struggle. 2. if the government commission agrees to the above requests , the fmln will agree to a meeting and is willing to immediately decide on a date and a time for the meeting. the fmln is even willing to hold the meeting outside el salvador. as a part of this meeting , we are willing to negotiate and come to an agreement with the armed forces staff on a cease-fire that will bring about a permanent and negotiated solution to the conflict. 3. if no such agreement is reached , then there is no point in holding the meeting prior to 19 march , because it will simply be used by both the christian democratic party ( pdc ) and the nationalist republican alliance ( arena ) in their election dispute. the elections play no role in achieving peace ; they only serve to provide a false justification for continuing the war. 4. we await a response from the government commission. el salvador , 9 march 1989 fmln general command ( signed ) commander salvador sanchez ceren commander francisco jovel commander jorge shafik handal commander eduardo sancho commander joaquin villalobos
